<p>
  This blog has been pretty quiet lately, because I recently moved
  from Calgary to sunny California.  I took a job with <a href="http://www.starviewinc.com/">Starview</a> in San
  Jose, and I'm living nearby in Sunnyvale.  Things are going really
  well with the job, and I've been working hard so that I can make an
  impact right out of the gate.  Of course, that cuts down on the time
  that I have for writing blogs.  So that's what I've been up to.  On
  with the story of the hike.

<p>
  Section B ends in an ugly way under an interstate highway overpass.
  It's sandy, and that's hard to walk on.  By the time we got there,
  it was already after noon, and mighty hot.  A wall of clouds loomed,
  but it was easy to disregard them, considering that we were still in
  what could easily be considered desert.  The clouds were to one side
  and Palm Springs was on the other.  We were moving closer to Palm
  Springs, so there was no way it was going to rain.  (Have you
  guessed that it's going to rain yet?)
</p>
<p>
  As we walked, we came nearer to a wind farm, the first of two that
  we would walk past on our hike.  It is a little hard to imagine how
  large the turbines are when you just see them fleetingly as you
  drive past, but when you walk near them, you get the full
  experience.  They aren't messing around.  There is a little man-made
  oasis near a maintenance truck by the wind farm where there is shade
  and refreshments, so we took a break and tended to our feet for a
  while before we started moving again.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vQn_UOPq5WE/Tdk4j0aSxaI/AAAAAAAABeo/uA1H-sRNowg/s800/DSCF0561.JPG"  alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vQn_UOPq5WE/Tdk4j0aSxaI/AAAAAAAABeo/uA1H-sRNowg/s800/DSCF0561.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  A little after we left, it started raining.  At first it was a
  relief.  We had been walking under completely blue skies in Southern
  California for around two weeks, and the variety was nice.  However,
  I had been expecting the blue skies and had not packed any rain gear
  for this part of the journey (I sent it all to the beginning of the
  Sierras).  So after a while, even my fleece was getting
  waterlogged.  Our plan upon leaving the oasis had been to try to get
  to a fish hatchery that was about a half a mile off-trail.  Since it
  would clearly be the only shelter for miles, it became a must.
</p>
<p>
  I had been hiking in the vicinity of Garby, Raven, and Lovebird all
  day, and we met up near where we thought the junction with the
  fish-hatchery trail would be.  In fact, I thought that we were at
  the junction because I was misreading the map.  In my defense, it's
  pretty hard to read a map through a plastic bag in a hard rain, but
  that doesn't change the fact that I was misreading the map.  I was
  lucky that Raven was more persuasive than me, and convinced us to go
  on until we actually found the junction.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually we made it to the fish hatchery, where there was shelter
  (a gazebo-like structure for tourists to picnic under).  We had gone
  over 27 miles on the day &ndash; more than 1% of the trail.  I quickly
  set up my hammock between two beams of the gazebo, but the setup
  wasn't optimal, and the wind kept waking me up throughout the night
  by flapping the tarp.
</p>
<p>
  The next day was almost completely uphill.  The rain was gone and it
  was hot once again.  I got an early start, but that only gets you so
  much.  
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uXHQpSRVdnY/Tdk4tpTOZJI/AAAAAAAABes/Zg3tvddCOsE/s800/DSCF0562.JPG"  alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uXHQpSRVdnY/Tdk4tpTOZJI/AAAAAAAABes/Zg3tvddCOsE/s800/DSCF0562.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  We walked up the basin formed by a creek for almost the whole day.
  By the end of the day, we had climbed around 5000 feet.  It was cold
  at night at that altitude and there were pine trees.  We ran into
  some fun people at the camp site, most notably Love it or Leave it
  (abbreviated LoL) and Hercules.  Hercules will show up again much
  later in the story, but we will meet LoL and his friend Boris (aka
  Overdrive) again much sooner.
</p>
<p>
  After our long climb, Garby and I kept the next day nice and easy,
  setting ourselves up for a nearo into the town of Big Bear.  We
  found a nice camp at around 3 and then just rested for the remainder
  of the day.  We even made a camp fire.  Unfortunately, Lovebird had
  shin splints, so he and Raven hitched in to Big Bear by an alternate
  road before our camp.  We would see them in town, but it was the
  last I would hike with them for quite a while.
</p>
<p>
  On the Appalachian Trail, you can tell that you are having a good
  day if you can do "12 by 12".  That is, 12 miles by noon.  Garby and
  I had 9 miles to go to get to the road into Big Bear the next day
  and we made it by 9 o'clock.  9 by 9 is so much better than 12 by
  12 that I was pretty impressed, but perhaps it's one of those things
  that doesn't really translate.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, we spent the day in Big Bear.  It's a very spread-out town,
  which makes it bad for hikers, so I won't say too much about it.
  (Other than to note that it has the smallest ski hill I think I've
  ever seen.  Seriously, there must be sand dunes that are bigger.)
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  Following our day in Big Bear, we must have walked for a while, but
  I don't remember it at all.  So I'll skip it.  The day after that,
  we made one of our biggest mistakes on the trail.  A section of the
  trail was closed due to a rock slide, and an alternate route was
  given.  We took the alternate.
</p>
<p>
  At first, it didn't look too bad. It was mostly on dirt roads, but
  there wasn't any traffic.  However, we soon turned off the dirt road
  onto off-road-vehicle roads.  It was a Friday, and the off-roaders
  were out in force.  There were vehicles of all shapes and sizes from
  dirt bikes to Hummers.  Every 20 minutes or so, there would be a
  procession of them.  The passengers would hold up their fingers
  indicating how many more were coming, which is thoughtful, but also
  disheartening.  "Really, there are 7 more of you jerks disrupting my
  day?"
</p>
<p>
  We ate lunch by a little creek and I got some water out of it,
  upstream of its crossing with the road.  It was a good thing that I
  did, because as we were eating lunch, three Jeeps came to the
  creek.  We sat and watched as they crossed and re-crossed the creek
  4 or 5 times, a different passenger getting out and taking video of
  the crossing each time.  It was maddening.
</p>
<p>
  We later heard that if we had not taken the alternate, the trail
  would have been beautiful and the rock slide not too bad.  Also,
  Deep Creek, which is where the trail went, is a natural hot spring
  that is clothing-optional.  The day that we missed it, there was a
  rumored nude photo shoot there.  Now of course this is a only trail
  rumor, so who knows if it's true, but it sure sounds like the kind
  of thing that I would have liked to have verified for myself.  For
  science, of course.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, by the end of the long day, we finished the alternate route
  and were back on the trail.  We met an older lady, and being a bit
  dumb, I didn't realize who she was until she was already gone.  Her
  name is Mother Goose, and she is an a true trail legend.  She is
  still going strong &ndash; according to her <a href="http://www.postholer.com/mothergoose">trail journal</a>, she is hiking
  the PCT again this year.  I set up my hammock in some scrubby trees
  on a hillside and it rained again at night.
</p>
<p>
  It kept raining the next morning, and I got as colder as the day
  went on.  My strategy in situations like that is generally to push
  on and keep moving so that I generate body heat.  That day, however,
  it was really bad.  It just never let up.  Eventually I met up with
  Garby at an underpass where we found some shelter from the rain.  I
  tried to tear open a pack of crackers, but my fingers were so cold
  that they had lost the strength required even for that.  Out of the
  rain, we warmed up again, and eventually found the courage to hike
  on.
</p>
<p>
  It didn't rain much longer that day, and before long we were drying
  our tarps in the sun.  The terrain also became more deserty again,
  which was heartening.  I was really tired of rain by that point.  I
  had not expected it or packed for it.  Even when you're ready for
  it, cold rain isn't much fun, but when you're not ready for it, it's
  downright awful.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, in the afternoon, we walked by some very windy cliffs to
  Cajon Pass.  It sounds nice, but it's really a McDonald's and a Best
  Western at a highway rest stop.  I got my customary chocolate shake,
  and a room at the Best Western.  I was tired from the long days
  and walking in the rain, so I slept deeply.

  Snow and ice.  Getting really lost.  Finally getting back to normal
  weather and having to take a "frog detour".  Boris and LoL get up to
  some shenanigans that keep people up at night.  Finally, we meet
  some of the nicest trail angels around.

<h2 id="sec-1">Warner Springs to Idyllwild</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  Leaving Warner Springs, my feet were getting tired.  I had started
  with shoes that had almost no padding (the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IHNHQK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004IHNHQK">Merrell Trail Glove</a>), and
  it was turning out that they were too minimal for the task at hand.
  They were fine for forests, but the rocky desert that I was walking
  on was not forgiving enough.  I had ordered some of my favorite
  trail runners to be sent to a cafe that was a couple of days away,
  though, so I was keen to get there.
</p>
<p>
  The first day out of Warner Springs, I met up with the group of
  three ladies that I met the day before Warner Springs.  We made it
  to a water tank by the early afternoon and then sat and shot the
  breeze during the really hot part of the day.  Annie's blisters were
  still really bad, but she had gotten epsom salts in town, and she
  spent quite a while soaking her feet in a plastic bag.
</p>
<p>
  We eventually hiked on, but it was starting to get dark quickly.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2OWhQv6J7RU/Tdk1sPcwPXI/AAAAAAAABcE/tiQCf5BoyCQ/s640/DSCF0533.JPG"  alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2OWhQv6J7RU/Tdk1sPcwPXI/AAAAAAAABcE/tiQCf5BoyCQ/s640/DSCF0533.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  Eventually we got to a spot with some flat areas where tents could
  be set up.  Unfortunately for me, there were no trees where I could
  hang my hammock, so I had to "cowboy camp".  It's a pretty common
  thing to do, especially on the PCT, where there is very little
  rain.  Basically, it is camping without any shelter.  I put the tarp
  of my hammock down and my mat and sleeping back on top of it.  The
  bugs were pretty bad (I kept Annie awake by slapping at mosquitoes),
  and the ground was a lot less comfortable than my hammock, but I
  made it through the night.  Thankfully, it was one of the very few
  times that I was forced to sleep on the ground during the whole
  trip.
</p>
<p>
  The next day was, for me, a big day.  I wanted to get to the cafe as
  quickly as possible to get my shoes.  We started early, but before
  long it was hot again.  Raven, Lovebird, and Garby, who had all left
  Warner Springs a bit after I had, caught and passed me.  Eventually
  we all met at a water cache and again tried to wait out the sun.
</p>
<p>
  I found that I couldn't wait.  New shoes were just too close and too
  tantalizing.  It was really hot, but they would have cold drinks at
  the cafe.  I walked on, up and down hills, and across dirt roads
  with no trail magic until I finally got to the top of a hill where I
  could see the road with the cafe.  I could see Annie ahead of me, and
  I knew that she would have no trouble getting a ride.  I was also
  really excited about the cafe.  So I started running down the hill
  towards the road.
</p>
<p>
  Annie really had no trouble getting the ride &ndash; I think someone
  stopped before she had enough put out her thumb, so I was on my
  own.  Before long Raven and Lovebird showed up and the three of us
  got a ride together.  After a short ride, we were at Paradise Valley
  Cafe. 
</p>
<p>
  Paradise Valley Cafe really is a paradise, especially for
  thru-hikers.  First, it has one of the best waitresses I have ever
  seen.  She was a marvel of efficiency, giving us ice water as soon
  as we came in and refilling our drinks well before they ran dry.
  She was even reading hiking books in an effort to connect better
  with her clientele.  It also has really good burgers (of course I
  got the veggie patty), and is in a really beautiful location.  What
  made me the happiest, though, was my new shoes.  After 150 miles of
  shoes with no padding at all, they felt like walking on cushions.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually we had to leave paradise.  It was late, and there was a
  little trail behind the cafe back to the PCT, so I walked down that
  until I found a couple of trees where I could hang my hammock.  All
  the trees were too big or too far apart until I got nearly all the
  way to the trail.  Even then, I had to be very creative to make the
  hammock work.
</p>
<p>
  I was up early the next day and moving a lot faster.  We were
  heading into the San Jacinto mountains, and the elevation gain meant
  that we would get some respite from the heat.  Down below was the
  desert and Palm Springs, and I was glad not to be there.

</p>
<p>
  I slept on the side of a mountain that night, and the next morning
  came to some snow-covered trail.  At that point, it was still enough
  of a novelty that I took a picture.

</p>
<p>
  Later that day I made it down a steep side trail to Idyllwild, and
  met up with the rest of the crew.  We had a Mexican feast and
  listened to some really good live music until "hiker midnight" (9
  PM).
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Fuller Ridge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  Up early the next day to hike back up the side trail.  We had more
  snow ahead of us, and the dreaded Fuller Ridge.  People had been
  hyping Fuller Ridge for at least 50 miles, and as with most things
  in life, it didn't live up to the hype.
</p>
<p>
  Though I'm writing about it now with some bravado, I must admit that
  I was glad to be with a group.  Even better was having Lovebird and
  Raven in the group, who are from the Yukon and have a lot of
  experience hiking on snow.  Garby showed me how to shorten one
  hiking pole while walking on the side of a ridge, but all in all
  Fuller Ridge really wasn't that bad.  The most difficult thing was
  navigating on the snow.  We had a good idea of where we were on the
  map, and using some intuition and my altimeter watch, we were able
  to stay at the right elevation.  When we walked over the wilderness
  sign that was buried almost to its top in the snow, we knew we were
  at the right place.
</p>
<p>
  We ended the day at a trailhead whose elevation was not much
  different from the top of the ridge.  It had already been raining a
  bit during the day, and it continued into the night.  Because of the
  elevation, it froze over night and I awoke to find a thin layer of
  ice covering my hammock's tarp.  Since my new shoes were frozen, I
  wore my old ones for a while that morning as we started our
  descent.
</p>
<p>
  The descent from Fuller Ridge is kind of amazing.  The factoid on
  the map states that it's 4.3 miles in a straight line but 15.2 miles
  on the trail.  It's just one switchback after another.  It's a
  little boring, but we made quick work of it.  We got to the bottom
  by noon.  We had lost about 7000 feet of elevation in the morning
  and were in the boiling heat of the sun once more.

  Some editing will be in order if I ever want to finish writing about
  this hike.  I remember it all so vividly, though, and I enjoy
  reliving the details.  Anyway, we will go past a wind farm and get
  caught in the rain.  We will miss some of the best sights on the
  trail because we stupidly followed the law and took a marked
  detour.  And a Best Western will never have seemed so good after a
  tough day with some more rain.

<a href="./posts/cljs-macros-02/">More Clojurescript Macros</a>

</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Most of my time this week was spent traveling and in meetings, but I
did have a chance to work on the Clojurescript macro system that I
have been working on.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Testing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  Things didn't start too well for the system, since it would not run
  the simplest of tests written for it in the Clojurescript testing
  system.  My test was a macro that would take a positive integer,
  recursively decrease it until it was zero, and then output the
  zero.  (Clearly not the smartest macro in the world &ndash; it was just
  meant to test recursion.)  However, I kept getting errors saying
  that the system didn't know how to test equality among numbers.
  This seemed strange until I realized that the <code>extend-type</code> call for
  numbers wasn't getting executed because it wasn't expanded into a
  <code>def</code>.  (I had been executing all <code>def</code> calls, which defined all
  functions and variables, but nothing else.)
</p>
<p>
  So I briefly flirted with executing a bunch of other special forms,
  including <code>set!</code> and <code>deftype</code>, but I could see that this would make
  things pretty unwieldy, and that the compiler would be doing a lot
  of confusing things, for example trying to execute a <code>set!</code> that was
  buried deep inside a function without being able to know anything
  about the locals that it was being set to.
</p>
<p>
  That was clearly the way of madness, so I eventually decided to
  execute every special form that was at the top level.  This worked
  really well, and the tests started passing.
</p>
<p>
  I also added tests to make sure that the namespaces work as
  expected.  You can <code>use</code> or <code>require</code> macros from other namespaces
  just like other functions.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">What's not there (yet)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  So far I have not added the <code>&amp;env</code> and <code>&amp;form</code> variables to macros.
  I expect that it will be necessary to add them at some point (and
  honestly not too hard).  I know they are extremely useful in some
  projects like <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.match">core.match</a>, but that project has already been ported
  to Clojurescript (via Clojure macros), so it might make more sense
  to leave the large macros that need those facilities to Clojure.
</p>
<p>
  Backquoted forms don't work as nicely as in Clojure.  The reason is
  that we are using Clojure's reader, which qualifies backquoted
  symbols with their full namespace.  Unfortunately, it doesn't know
  anything about Clojurescript namespaces, so expect to need to
  qualify symbols inside backquotes.  This is an area where true
  reader macros inside Clojure would be really helpful, but we have to
  live with what we have.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">One step closer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  &hellip; to Clojure in Clojure.  Clojurescript already has a reader and a
  compiler that can compile most of itself.  The reader isn't totally
  complete &ndash; it doesn't have backquote working yet for example &ndash; but
  it is close.  It recently got persistent vectors and persistent
  hash-maps.  With macros added, all that's left for Clojure in
  Clojure is to finish up the reader and get rid of the calls to
  Java.

<a href="./posts/hiking/socal-01/">California Section A</a>

</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Here we go on the first post of my recap of my experience on the
Pacific Crest Trail.  It's been nearly a year since I started, and I
didn't keep records of where I stayed as well as on the <a href="./tags/AT">AT</a>, so this
recap will probably be a bit less detailed than that one (which might
be a good thing).
</p>
<p>
Here's the obligatory "before" photo:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4xYuJjCRfeo/TdkxHjmx2MI/AAAAAAAABXU/8_DU5RSDSio/s800/DSCF0494.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4xYuJjCRfeo/TdkxHjmx2MI/AAAAAAAABXU/8_DU5RSDSio/s800/DSCF0494.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
Across the wall behind me is Mexico.  My shirt is clean, my pack's
color is vivid, and my face is clean-shaven.  None of those things
would be true for very long on this hike.  I had arrived at the border
at around 6:30 PM, so I didn't plan to go very far that evening.  I
passed the first mile-marker on my way to the small town near the
trailhead:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ia1Kk0DJplw/TdkxihMR9VI/AAAAAAAABX0/fR580G6sFbQ/s640/DSCF0495.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ia1Kk0DJplw/TdkxihMR9VI/AAAAAAAABX0/fR580G6sFbQ/s640/DSCF0495.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
I had food with me, but no water.  The store owner (because the town
was little more than a convenience store) made me buy water.  Since
Southern California is mostly a desert, I felt it was the best idea to
go along with it.  I walked a bit longer (I made maybe about three
miles on the first evening), found a place to set up my hammock, made
supper and went to bed.
</p>
<p>
The next day really showed the rigors of desert hiking.  With the sun
beating down and hardly any shade, it wasn't long before things got
really hot.  I heard my first rattlesnake in bushes nearby, but I just
kept trudging on.  At lunchtime, though, I found a bit of shade at the
bottom of a hill near a flowing stream.  There was another hiker there
with the trail name Hikeaholic.  He had hiked the PCT before and had
even been a maintainer of the trail in Washington, and he was quite
encouraging about my chances.  After lunch, we parted ways, and I went
on to the Lake Morena campsite for the first day of what is known as
the Kickoff.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://adzpctko.org">Kickoff</a> is an annual event where many of the northbound hikers
(which is just about everyone on the PCT) get together.  Gear
companies show up along with trail "alumni" who want to re-live the
fun and scare the newbies.  There were a few hundred tents set up in
the campsite by the evening, and the next morning I thought that I had
seen enough.  I go hiking to avoid crowds of that size, so I started
down the trail in the cool of the morning.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GHRj21tyVm8/Tdkx1FUfjMI/AAAAAAAABYY/zH2C1pKtysk/s800/DSCF0499.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GHRj21tyVm8/Tdkx1FUfjMI/AAAAAAAABYY/zH2C1pKtysk/s800/DSCF0499.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
I was on my own for most of the day, but I met two couples that I
would later hike with for long distances: Raven and Lovebird, and
Funyan and Meow-Meow.  Of course, they didn't have their trail names
at that point, but after a while it becomes more natural to refer to
people by their trail names than their actual names.  At the end of
the day, I set up camp just above a dry creek bed with another person
with whom I would hike most of Southern California: a tall guy who got
the trail name Garby from his ability to clean everyone's plates
like a garbage disposal.
</p>
<p>
The next day actually had some pine forest, which was a bit of a
surprise.  I enjoyed the shade, but it didn't last long, and
eventually I was back in the sun.  I ended the day in a campsite that
was the last bit of green on the map for many miles.  I had gotten
there minutes after Lovebird, Raven, and Garby.  There was another
person that I hadn't met before, who introduced himself as Swope.  I
told the group that my intention was to stay at the campsite so that I
could be sure to find a place to hang my hammock.  I very quickly
regretted it as Swope announced that that made us hiking buddies,
because he was staying there as well.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZRMjGMQuBCo/TdkzIapsZWI/AAAAAAAABaQ/tmmio8Ram0w/s800/DSCF0510.JPG"  alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZRMjGMQuBCo/TdkzIapsZWI/AAAAAAAABaQ/tmmio8Ram0w/s800/DSCF0510.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
I could tell that Swope was a little off, and as the evening went on,
it became even more clear.  He talked a mile a minute about some very
strange topics, he clearly hadn't been long-distance hiking before,
and he had a massive pack (around 50 pounds) whose weight he had
reduced from about 80 pounds the day before.  He even had a satellite
phone with him &ndash; pretty strange for someone who wanted to get away
from civilization.  Eventually, I had all that I could take and
escaped to my hammock for some shuteye.  (Sorry Swope if you ever read
this.  Some people are just not natural hiking companions.)  Swope got
out of camp ahead of me the next morning, but given his huge pack, I
had no trouble passing him very quickly.
</p>
<p>
The hiking was turning out to be slightly different than I had
expected.  When I think of the desert, I imagine really sandy areas
with almost no vegetation.  This was fairly rocky with shrubs and
brushy trees.  Desert is actually a misnomer: the ecosystem is known
as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral">chaparral</a>.  It was still hot, though, and when I got to a water
tank at around noon, I decided to wait out the sun for a while.  While
I was waiting, I met Skinny D.  We talked for a while, and then she
went on ahead of me.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Gj3_sGqRax4/Tdkzbwn54EI/AAAAAAAABaA/At4SK3R1Y5c/s800/DSCF0513.JPG"  alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Gj3_sGqRax4/Tdkzbwn54EI/AAAAAAAABaA/At4SK3R1Y5c/s800/DSCF0513.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
We met again at Scissors Crossing &ndash; an awkward intersection of roads
&ndash; where trail angels had left water, energy drinks, beer, and even a
pie.  It was supper time, so we ate supper and then had the pie for
desert.  Skinny D went a bit farther, but I found some trees near a
dried creek bed, and hung out there.  It was surprisingly cold over
night &ndash; the lack of moisture in the air causes that to happen &ndash; and
I was glad to get moving the next morning so that I could get warm.
</p>
<p>
That day highlighted another big difference between the PCT and the
AT.  The whole day was spent going over one big hill.  On the AT, the
hills come thick and fast, but on the PCT they are much more gradual.
The net effect is that you spend a long time going up and then a long
time going down.  We finished the day just past mile 100, where I met
up with many of the people I had met earlier as well as two new ones:
Liz and Annie.  Annie had terrible blisters, but she was pushing
through the pain, which eventually led to her trail name "Push".
</p>
<p>
It was only about 7 miles to the first trail town &ndash; Warner Springs.
There's really not much more to the town than a small resort and a
gas-station convenience store, where I picked up my first resupply.
</p>
<p>
After getting to Warner Springs nice and early, I got a room at the
resort with Garby, and we had a lot of fun there with Raven and
Lovebird as well.  While we were eating at the pub, a
bedraggled-looking Swope walked in.  He was clearly the worse for
wear, and had only hiked as far as Scissors Crossing (meaning that he
had somehow gotten a day behind me despite starting at the same time
two days earlier).  He then hitchhiked to Warner Springs and was
intending to get a ride back to Scissors Crossing and return to Warner
Springs by running.  It was, as always, an unconventional approach.
It was the last I would see of him, but I did hear that he made it
farther than I had expected (though I don't know if he finished).
</p>
<p>
Later that night, the four of us went for a dip in the hot pool that
is fed by the hot springs.  It's debatable whether it hurt or helped
our hiking, but it was nice and relaxing.

<p>
  There will be fewer characters to introduce, so hopefully I can
  write about more than one section.  The trail goes from chaparral to
  mountains and back, and we have a snow storm in the mountains and a
  rain storm in the desert.  Hopefully I'll be able to get to the part
  where I get massively lost by walking down the wrong mountain
  ridge.  That was fun.

<a href="./posts/cljs-macros/">Clojurescript Macros</a>

</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Today I wrote a proof-of-concept implementation of a macro system for
Clojurescript.  The code is <a href="https://github.com/chrismgray/clojurescript/tree/defmacro">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Clojurescript already had a sort of macro system in the form of
Clojure macros, but this is different &ndash; the macros are written in
Clojurescript, get compiled to JavaScript, and are evaluated by a
JavaScript interpreter.  They can be mixed in with Clojurescript code
and call Clojurescript functions.  In theory, they should work with
any Clojurescript backend that implements the REPL-related protocols
(but who knows if that's true).
</p>
<p>
So that's the big announcement.  What follows are some implementation
details and other notes.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Implementation details</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  The macros are defined by passing strings back and forth between the
  Clojurescript compiler and the Rhino JavaScript interpreter.  The
  strings from Rhino are read by Clojure using <code>read-string</code>, so
  macros are limited to things that can be printed by Clojurescript in
  a form that Clojure can read.
</p>
<p>
  Macros are not yet put into the correct namespaces.  I don't think
  it will be too hard to do that correctly though.
</p>
<p>
  Rhino is a slow beast.  It adds multiple seconds to the startup time
  of the compiler.  It might be smart to scan the file for calls to
  <code>defmacro</code> before including the macro-interpreting code.  However,
  since macro expansion requires that all functions are defined in the
  interpreter, once a <code>defmacro</code> is hit, all the functions in the file
  preceding it (and in all <code>require</code>'d files) must be re-parsed.
</p>
<p>
  Existing Clojure macros should still work.  If two macros have the
  same name, the Clojurescript one will take precedence, but of course
  getting namespaces working should eliminate most conflicts.
</p>
<p>
  It should go without saying that this is completely experimental at
  this point.  Things seem like they work to me, but they might yet
  blow up in unexpected ways.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">An example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  Here is a simple Clojurescript file which implements the <code>unless</code>
  macro (also known as <code>when-not</code> in Clojure, but I think giving it a
  different name shows better that it is really not using the Clojure
  macros).
</p>



<pre class="src src-clojure">(<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">defmacro</span> <span style="color: #8cd0d3;">unless</span>
  [pred &amp; body]
  `(<span style="color: #8cd0d3;">if</span> (<span style="color: #f0dfaf;">not</span> ~pred)
     (<span style="color: #8cd0d3;">do</span> ~@body)
     nil))

(<span style="color: #8cd0d3;">let</span> [a (unless true (<span style="color: #f0dfaf;">/</span> 1 0) (<span style="color: #f0dfaf;">+</span> 1 1))]
  a)
</pre>


<p>
  And here is its output:
</p>



<pre class="src src-javascript"><span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">var</span> <span style="color: #f0dfaf;">a__5799</span> = (cljs.core.truth_(cljs.core.not.call(<span style="color: #dca3a3; font-weight: bold;">null</span>,<span style="color: #dca3a3; font-weight: bold;">true</span>))?(<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">function</span> (){(1 / 0);
<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">return</span> (1 + 1);
})():<span style="color: #dca3a3; font-weight: bold;">null</span>);

a__5799;
</pre>


<p>
  It's a bit ugly, but it should be obvious what's going on.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  I'm pretty happy with the progress so far.  It really shows how
  flexible the Clojurescript compiler is that a macro system could be
  added in under 75 lines of code, with nearly half of that being very
  lightly modified from the compiler itself.

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>This past week, I've been knee-deep in Clojure data structures --
mostly persistent vector and hash-map.  The goal has been to provide
replacements written in pure Clojure that can be ported to
ClojureScript, but it has also been a great way to learn about how
these structures work.  So in this post, I'll try to summarize what I
learned, and give some the results of my hacking.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Vector</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  I started this project inspired by a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/swannodette">David Nolen</a>.  I can't
  find it any more, but he mentioned that he had ported the
  persistent-vector data structure to JavaScript and that he was
  hoping to use it in ClojureScript.  That made me think: since
  the ClojureScript compiler now supports languages other than
  JavaScript as its backends, wouldn't it be helpful, at least for
  those backends, to port the data structure to pure Clojure, so that
  any ClojureScript backend could use it?
</p>
<p>
  So I did.  The result is <a href="https://github.com/chrismgray/persistent-data-structures/blob/master/src/persistent_data_structures/vector.clj">here</a>.  Instead of merely mechanically
  porting the Java into Clojure, I tried to really understand what was
  going on.  The gist is really simple (and has been talked about
  before): the vector is actually a tree with branching-factor 32, and
  a buffer of size 32.  When you add to the vector, you really add to
  the buffer if you can, copying the buffer before writing to it.
  When the buffer fills up, it is put in the tree, and again nodes are
  copied rather than simply written-to.
</p>
<p>
  This procedure means that adding an element is a \(O(\log n)\)
  operation, but the constants are really good: for one thing, the
  base of the \(\log\) is 32, so the influence of the \(\log n\) in
  the overall running time is pretty small even for very large \(n\).
  For another thing, the \(\log n\) penalty is only incurred on every
  thirty-second insert.  Most inserts are constant-time.
</p>
<p>
  Another cool feature is the way that the tree is structured.  Each
  node has its children in an array of length 32.  This means that the
  subtree that contains a given element can be found very quickly by
  simple bit operations.  To find the subtree containing element \(i\)
  in tree level \(k\), you shift \(i\) to the right by \(5k\) places
  and take the rightmost 5 bits.  This procedure would work with
  arrays that are of length of any power of 2, where you replace 5 by
  the \(\log_2\) of the length.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, László Török had pretty much the same idea as I did (and the
  author of gvec.clj, which is in the core distribution, had the same
  idea before either of us), and his code was better-tuned than mine,
  so it is what went into the new release of ClojureScript.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">An aside</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
   When vectors are created in Clojure (but not yet in ClojureScript),
   they are created by way of a transient vector.  The idea behind this
   is that the transient vector is only around for the creation of the
   vector, so it does not need to be persistent.  Thus, it does not
   need to use the copy-on-write policy that persistent vectors use.
   In order to build a larger vector, it simply adds to an empty vector
   using the same procedure that I outlined above.
</p>
<p>
   Theoretically at least, that is not the optimal algorithm.  The
   trees can be built from the bottom-up (much like <a href="./posts/clojure-sorting">heaps</a>), giving a
   \(O(n)\) algorithm, which also has very good constants.  I haven't
   computed the constant, but it should be less than \(1 {1 \over
   16}\).  I implemented this algorithm in Clojure, but the difference
   in constants between Clojure code and pure Java code, and the fact
   that the constants in the Java implementation are <b>so</b> low meant
   that my implementation was slower even for very large \(n\).  I may
   one day try to port my bottom-up algorithm back to Java, but I kind
   of doubt it would make much difference.  Sometimes the
   theoretically better solution just isn't better in the real world.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Hash Maps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  I also had a look at hash maps.  The basic idea behind any hash-map
  is to store a key-value pair by first computing the <i>hash</i> of the
  key to something much smaller &ndash; in Clojure's case a 32-bit integer
  &ndash; and then storing the pair in a location based on that hash.
  There are many ways that this could be done, and I had a look at the
  Java implementation used in Clojure and decided that I didn't really
  want to do much more porting.  So I came up with a couple of ideas
  that are related to Clojure's way of doing it.
</p>
<p>
  The first idea was to make the same tree as used in the vector
  implementation, but to fill it in only as needed.  In essence, this
  was a sparse vector.  The Clojure implementation does something
  similar to this, but goes one step further by using a bit-map to
  signify which branches of the tree are actually used.  In this way,
  it can avoid copying arrays that are mostly full of placeholders.
</p>
<p>
  The next idea was a bit more radical.  It involved making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_trie">radix tree</a> of the input data.  Of all my experiments, this might have been
  the most successful.  In Clojure, its performance is very close to
  the built-in data structure.  In ClojureScript, for some reason it
  is much faster at storing new data than the built-in data structure
  but somewhat slower at retrieving data.  I am thinking that there
  must be some JavaScript-specific reason for this, but I haven't
  found it yet.  It could just be that the ClojureScript data
  structure is asymmetric in the opposite way (I haven't yet looked
  very deeply at it).
</p>
<p>
  In all cases, the theoretical running times are pretty much what
  you'd expect.  To either insert a new key-value pair or to find a
  key, it's basically the sum of the time needed to hash the key, a
  constant to find the place where the key is stored, and then
  something proportional to the number of other keys that have the
  same hash value that have been inserted so far.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, large collections must be hashed each time they're
  inserted or searched for, so using them as keys is probably not a
  great idea.  In Clojure, negative numbers hash to one less than
  their absolute value, so there will probably be collisions if you
  use a large number of positive and negative numbers as keys, but
  it's not that big of a deal, since the number of collisions
  generated by this is at most two.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-3">Conclusions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  At the very least, this was a good way to learn what's really going
  on under the hood.  I also did a lot of tuning &ndash; not only adding
  typehints, but re-implementing some lazy functions to be non-lazy --
  which is certainly good experience.  I never made a data structure
  that was faster than one of the ones implemented in Java, but I got
  pretty close in both cases.  In order to get meaningful tests, I had
  to do things in a very big way: putting millions of things in
  vectors, and querying hash-maps hundreds of thousands of times.
  Most programs will not do these operations at such scales, and most
  of the tests still took less than a second on my underpowered
  laptop.  That makes me think pretty highly of the existing data
  structures in Clojure.

<a href="./posts/org-ikiwiki-plugin-5/">Org Plugin Rethink</a>

</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>I am glad to announce a new version of my <a href="https://github.com/chrismgray/ikiwiki-org-plugin">ikiwiki org plugin</a>.  This is
a major change to the way things had worked previously, and is much
faster than previous versions.
</p>
<p>
The installation procedure has changed, so please read the
<code>README.org</code> file in the repository for information about how to
install the plugin.  Also, if you have installed a previous version,
please remove that since it may conflict.  Also be sure that you kill
any daemonized versions of emacs that are running.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Background</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  This version of the plugin is no longer what ikiwiki calls an
  "external plugin".  The overhead associated with XML-RPC was simply
  too high (at least on the emacs side of things).  I tried
  <a href="./posts/ikiwiki-hacking">working around</a> it by having less communication between the compiler
  and the plugin, but the ikiwiki developers <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/todo/be_more_selective_about_running_hooks/">didn't really think it was a great idea</a>.  So I have basically scrapped the idea of the
  plugin being external.
</p>
<p>
  The nice thing about that is that it allowed me to remove a lot of
  code on the emacs side.  Instead of communication via XML-RPC, the
  new plugin can put the content to be interpreted in a file and call
  emacsclient directly.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Security</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  I note in <code>README.org</code> that there is a concern about security.  This
  is because any program that calls another program with
  user-generated arguments should be concerned about security.  As far
  as I can tell, the only way that something bad can happen is if
  someone creates a filename with an unmatched double-quote and
  convinces ikiwiki to accept it.  Since ikiwiki doesn't accept
  filenames with double-quotes anyway, there really shouldn't be a
  problem.
</p>
<p>
  However, I would recommend that this plugin not be used in
  situations where untrusted people can create files (such as from the
  CGI interface), unless you personally verify that nothing bad can
  happen.  As always, this is free software and comes with no
  warranty.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Remaining todos</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  I would like to get rid of the potential security hole so that
  people could feel safe running this plugin from the CGI interface.
  I would also like to get rid of the hardcoded org configuration and
  let that be stored in the user's setup file.  I have a branch that
  does that using the old architecture, so it should not be too
  difficult to port to the new architecture.

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Now that I have written an account of my <a href="./tags/AT">AT hike</a>, I thought I would
write down some things that I think are true about hiking before
writing about the next hike.  The first thing to note is that I
subscribe completely to the hike-your-own-hike (HYOH) philosophy, so
this should be read as descriptive more than prescriptive.

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Leave No Trace</h2>

<p>
  Okay, I lied.  This is the one prescription.  Read the <a href="http://lnt.org/programs/principles.php">principles</a>
  and follow them.  Also follow any other rules that are in place for
  the area that you're in.  If it says not to make camp fires, then
  don't.  It's a pity to need to say this, but I've seen experienced
  hikers break the rules (and I'm not perfect either, but I do my
  best).

<h2 id="sec-2">Animals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  So much of the conversation about hiking with non-hikers or
  inexperienced hikers is about dangerous animals.  I probably saw
  less than one bear for every month of hiking that I did, and they
  were all running away from me.  I never hiked in grizzy country, and
  if I ever do, I'll think about maybe carrying bear spray, though I
  doubt I will in the end.  Wilderness is vast and bears and other
  dangerous animals are sparse.  They generally don't want anything to
  do with us.
</p>
<p>
  The most scared I was of an animal on the AT was the time I saw a
  skunk on the trail in the Shenandoahs.

   I love my hammock.  It's lighter than many tents, far more

   suitable trees.  This is easy in a pine forest and is probably
   impossible in the plains.

   about $100 and lasts about 1000 miles, so that works out.

<div id="outline-container-3-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-3-4">Clothes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-4">


<p>
   All synthetic.  For the AT hike, I wore the same shirt and shorts
   most of the way.  I got a new pair of shorts in Damascus, just
   because I was getting tired of the pair that I was wearing.  I
   started my AT hike with three pairs of socks and they lasted me the
   whole way.  I would generally change socks only as needed because
   they were wet or once per week during dry sections.  I carried the
   following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>One short-sleeved shirt
</li>
<li>One long-sleeved shirt
</li>
<li>Two pairs of underwear
</li>
<li>One pair of shorts
</li>
<li>One pair of long pants
</li>
<li>Three pairs of socks
</li>
<li>One fleece
</li>
<li>One rain jacket
</li>
<li>One down jacket
</li>
</ul>


<p>     
   On sections that I knew would be very cold, I carried a hat and
   gloves.  In the Sierras I carried wool tights as well, and there
   were nights where I wore everything that I was carrying.

<p>
   I have a fairly generic down sleeping bag from <a href="http://mec.ca">MEC</a>.  Since it's

   The main change between my hikes was my stove.  On my AT hike, I

   varying levels of heat and is very fuel efficient &ndash; but I thought
   it was a bit heavy for one person.  So on my PCT hike, I took a
   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LDCVBY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003LDCVBY">Vargo</a> titanium alcohol stove.  It was lighter, but only had one
   temperature, was more prone to accidents, was a pain to fill, and
   required more fuel.  I know that if I was going on a hike with more
   than one person, I would take the Whisperlite, but I don't know
   what I'd do on another solo hike.

   for my PCT hike.  Since the AT is so well marked, only an elevation
   profile is necessary so that you know how difficult the next
   stretch of trail will be.  On the other hand, it is important to
   have maps on the PCT because there are places where the trail is
   not obvious.

<p>
  I'm a firm believer that you should always pack in a consistent
  manner.  This saves you time rooting around in your pack.  The only
  tip that I have is that the sleeping bag should go on the bottom.
  You won't need it all day, and it's nice to have something soft on
  the bottom of your pack if you put it down quickly or fall down
  backwards.  Other than that, I don't think the order matters too
  much as long as it's consistent.

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">People</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
  Both of my long hikes have been solo hikes in the sense that I made
  no explicit arrangement with anyone else to hike together.  In both
  hikes, I have had periods of being truly alone and periods where I
  would regularly meet up with the same people nearly every night.  I
  probably enjoyed myself the most when I was in groups of three or
  four, but I also think that it would be nearly impossible for me to
  stay with one single group for an entire hike.
</p>
<p>
  The community aspect of hiking is one of its strongest
  selling-points.  You meet all kinds of people who are all doing the
  same thing as you.  So that gives you something to talk about right
  away.  Nothing bonds like shared misery.
</p>
<p>
  There is also a strong sense that everyone is looking out for each
  other.  This was put into the starkest relief for me when I was
  hiking in the Sierras on the PCT, so I'll go into it in more detail
  when I get around to writing about that.

<p>
  The next morning, back on the trail with three days of food, I took
  an early break.  I went to put my pack on, and the buckle for the
  hip belt broke!  Some people with ultralight packs can hike without
  a hip belt, but I am not one of them (though I wish I was).  For
  me, the hip belt is the thing that bears most of the weight of the
  pack and the shoulder straps are more for stabilization.  In short,
  this almost rose to the level of an emergency.  Had it been earlier
  in the trip, or if I had not set a self-imposed deadline for the end
  of the hike, I might have turned around and hiked back to the road.
</p>
<p>
  There was no way I was going to do that though.  I tried hiking
  without the hip belt for a little while, but it quickly became
  obvious that that wouldn't work.  It was time for some
  out-of-the-box thinking.  I seriously considered just leaving the
  pack behind and running the rest of the way to Springer.  I know
  that people run that far in less than 24 hours all the time, and
  considering the shape I was in, I probably could have done it.
  However, leaving all my stuff in the back woods of Georgia seemed
  like something to do only as a last resort, and spending a night
  without my pack would be too awful to risk.  Finally, I realized
  that I had my rope that I used to hang my bear bag.  I cut about a
  foot from that and tied the straps of my hip belt together.
</p>
<p>
  Thankfully, it worked.  I soon got just as good at tying the hip
  belt together as I had been at buckling it.  It looked a little
  funny, like a person with a rope for a belt, but in the woods
  there's really no one to judge that sort of thing.
</p>
<p>
  The terrain was hilly that day, and between that and my hip-belt
  disaster, I didn't make it that far.  I ended up on the top of Rocky
  Mountain with 52.2 miles to go and two full days of hiking left.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, the hills were less steep the next day, the weather was
  great, and I was on a roll.  With each mile that I got closer to the
  end of my journey, the better I felt.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Near the end of the day, I came to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Mountain">Blood Mountain</a>.  There is a
  shelter near the top, but it is 28.3 miles from Springer, so I kept
  on going.  I walked for about two more hours to get to a small
  campsite near a stream 22.3 miles from the finish line.  One day
  left, and within striking distance.
</p>
<p>
  The final day was much like the previous 131.  I got up early, had
  breakfast and walked.  I did see a small family of wild pigs in the
  morning, but it was otherwise a day pretty much like any other.  As
  I got closer to the end, my pace picked up, and I flew past some
  day-hikers.
</p>
<p>
  Springer Mountain is nothing compared to <a href="./posts/hiking/100-mile-wilderness">Katahdin</a>.  I am willing to
  stipulate that much.  Some will say that makes finishing a
  southbound AT hike anticlimactic, and that is one step too far for
  me.  I had walked nearly 2200 miles in the wilderness to get there;
  it was pretty damn climactic.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  I finished on my birthday, just as I had hoped.  It really was a
  great way to spend it.

<p>
  The terminus of the trail is the top of a mountain.  There is no
  road up to there &ndash; to get home you must take another trail.  I
  walked about a mile down that after finishing the AT, and camped one
  last time.  I was out of fuel, so I made my only campfire of the
  entire hike and made supper over that.
</p>
<p>
  I hiked out the next day past <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicalola_Falls">Amicalola Falls</a>.  At the end, there is
  a visitor's center, where I made sure to sign the final log book,
  and then I had to think about getting home.

</p>
<p>
  Hitching in a tourist area is never easy, so in the end I resorted
  to asking for rides from people who wanted to talk about my hike.  A
  nice older couple gave another hiker and me a ride into Atlanta, and
  just like that I was back in civilization.

<p>
  That's it for the AT, but it's less than half of my long hikes.
  Depending on my mood, I might start right in on the PCT, or I might
  go a little deeper into the gear I used and other more general
  thoughts that I have about hiking.

<p>
  I had a great time in Damascus with the little crew that I had met
  up with a few days earlier, but they wanted to stay in town a little
  longer than I did, so I went on without them.  The first day out of
  town, I had a certain shelter in mind to end at, but it got dark
  before I got there and, having no desire to night-hike, I simply
  stopped in the middle of a hill and set up my hammock.  I'm fairly
  sure that was one of my most random campsites.  I didn't think it
  looked any good as a campsite, but I was tired and wanted to stop.
</p>

<p>
  Maybe my thinking was skewed by the fact that I knew that if I could
  hike 25 miles per day for the next four days, I could stay at a
  hostel for each of them.   The first of these days took me to the
  Kincora hostel, home of Bob Peoples.  Bob is a trail maintainer in
  addition to being a hostel-keeper, and is a trail fixture.  Most of
  the graffiti in the shelters leading to his hostel consists of Chuck
  Norris-style jokes about him (all complimentary of course).  He has
  been running the hostel for over 20 years and still only charges $4
  per night.  While I was there, we sat and chatted a bit.  He told me
  about his previous hike in Europe and his plan for the next summer
  to work on the International AT in Canada, adding cairns so people
  can find their way in Newfoundland.  For an older guy (he must be
  nearly 70), he sure gets his kicks on the trail.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  The leaves by this point had all turned, and most of them were
  brown.  There were a few patches of color left, though.  For the
  most part, I was still in the "tunnel" of trees and branches, but
  the falling leaves gave some more opportunities to see outside it.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WZ8VczQj33M/TOXCMx27zhI/AAAAAAAABFE/cLmrOJSzRwg/s800/DSCF0359.JPG"  alt="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WZ8VczQj33M/TOXCMx27zhI/AAAAAAAABFE/cLmrOJSzRwg/s800/DSCF0359.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  The next night I made it to the next hostel.  This was the Mountain
  Harbour Hostel.  They have a room above a barn that is really nice,
  but unfortunately it was booked by the time that I got there.  I did
  use it to shower in and watched City Slickers (a great trail movie
  by the way) before going to bed in an RV.  It was comfortable, but
  not as neat as the barn.
</p>
<p>
  The next day started with a big climb up Hump Mountain.  It is the
  first of the "balds" that a southbound hiker hits.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S1hfxMHYxhA/TOXCPGGVckI/AAAAAAAABFw/-xlAKwyqRBc/s800/DSCF0366.JPG"  alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S1hfxMHYxhA/TOXCPGGVckI/AAAAAAAABFw/-xlAKwyqRBc/s800/DSCF0366.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  As you can see, there are no trees &ndash; it is just long grass.  After
  nearly 1800 miles of nearly consistent tree cover (and alpine
  terrain on the tops of mountains), this is a welcome change.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xv4qN3hMZf0/TOXCQy1_0lI/AAAAAAAABGQ/Uu7uw2GRvfQ/s800/DSCF0370.JPG"  alt="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xv4qN3hMZf0/TOXCQy1_0lI/AAAAAAAABGQ/Uu7uw2GRvfQ/s800/DSCF0370.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  Eventually the trail goes over 6000 feet elevation at Roan High
  Knob.  There is a shelter at the top, where I am sure it gets quite
  cold at night, but I wouldn't know because I wanted to get to the
  next hostel.
</p>
<p>
  The next hostel was not a hostel but a "friendly" (get it?
  hostel&hellip; hostile&hellip; friendly (it's not a great joke)).  The
  proprietress, who was quirky but nice, wasn't there when I arrived,
  but she left a key so that I could get situated and watch a little
  TV.  She cooked me a great breakfast the next morning and I was on
  my way to the next one.
</p>
<p>
  The weather that day was rainy, and I got to use the rain jacket
  that I had purchased in Virginia for the first time.  Going up some
  rather high mountains in a thunderstorm wasn't so fun, but I was on
  a mission.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Luckily, the rain didn't last long, and soon it was a mere memory.
  I kept pushing on and made it to Erwin, TN by mid-afternoon.  The
  hostel in Erwin had a bunch of old guys just hanging around.  I
  might have found them amusing under other circumstances, but as it
  was I just found them (and Erwin by extension) a little sad.
  I got a resupply that evening and was out early the next morning.

<p>
  Out of Erwin, there is some significant climbing, and that combined
  with the threat of rain conspired to stop me after only 16 miles.
  I was glad to have stopped, because it did rain that evening and
  some the next morning as well.  Once again, the rain cleared up by
  the afternoon, and by the end of the day I was happy to be walking
  down the trail.  At the end of the day I came upon Hot Springs, NC.
  It was dark by the time I found the hostel that I had heard about.
  It is run by a Buddhist monk who makes gourmet vegetarian food.
  Naturally, I took a zero there.
</p>
<p>
  By this time, I had done the math and determined that I could finish
  on my birthday if I kept a decent pace.  The zero set me back a
  little bit, so from then on I needed to really push: the only thing
  in my way was the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.
</p>
<p>
  I met up with Skittles again the day after I left Hot Springs.  He
  had a bit of a falling-out with the rest of the group (as I
  understood it) and had hiked ahead of them.  It was nice to be
  around someone that I knew again, but we had such radically
  different paces during the day that we were never around each other
  for very long.
</p>
<p>
  The next day ended just inside the national park at a shelter that
  had a chain-link fence enclosing it to keep the bears out.  There
  was a group there, and after a while it became clear to me that they
  were a church group.  Skittles showed up late and he never got the
  memo.  The next morning, he went with them to the top of a mountain
  off-trail (there were a couple of pretty young ladies in the group,
  and he thought he had a chance) and only found out then.  As he told
  me, he was pretty mad when he found out and spent a couple of hours
  arguing with them about the existence of God.
</p>
<p>
  I, on the other hand, went to a shelter half a mile off the trail
  and spent the night alone at a mile high.  There were bear warnings
  all over, but I didn't see one.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  I love views where the mountains seem to be stacked one behind the
  other.  The Smokies had that in abundance, and the haze in these
  photos really shows where they got their name.
</p>
<p>  
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-USFWqkYdXng/TOXCgu51wWI/AAAAAAAABJ0/CkG9EF1uqOo/s800/DSCF0394.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-USFWqkYdXng/TOXCgu51wWI/AAAAAAAABJ0/CkG9EF1uqOo/s800/DSCF0394.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  I was only about 10 miles from the road Gatlinburg, and got there
  easily by noon.  Despite the throngs of tourists, I wasn't able to
  get a hitch for over an hour (and even that was in the back of a
  pickup truck &ndash; not fun for 15 miles at 60 miles per hour).
</p>
<p>
  Gatlinburg is a strange place.  It's now overshadowed by Dollywood,
  but it was once the premier tourist destination in the area.  As
  such, it has everything you wouldn't expect: a Ripley's Believe it
  or Not, cable cars, a wax museum.  The only thing that isn't
  accessible in town is a grocery store.  I had to wait for a bus to
  take me out of town and back in order to resupply.  By the time I
  had gotten everything that I needed, it was getting pretty late, so
  I decided to stay in town.  The one advantage of it being such a
  touristy town is that there are many motels, and they're all pretty
  cheap.

  I got picked up by a guy going back to the trail to do some trail
  maintenance the next day.  Soon after getting dropped off, I hit the
  highest point on the trail &ndash; Clingman's Dome.  For some reason
  unknown to man, there is a completely ugly structure on top.  
</p>

</p>
<p>
  The hike was all relatively downhill from there<a href="http://instantrimshot.com/">.</a>  The next morning
  it snowed for the first time on the hike.  At first, this seemed
  exciting and fun, but it really was just a colder version of rain.
  I stayed at a shelter called the "Fontana Hilton" that night, so
  called because it's a large shelter near the Fontana Dam.  It's
  nowhere near as comfortable as a Hilton hotel, though, and it was
  packed for the night.
</p>
<p>
  The next day was even snowier.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-q0DG66O-4Fw/TOXCvSy-B6I/AAAAAAAABMg/dd4ADNAEevY/s800/DSCF0411.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-q0DG66O-4Fw/TOXCvSy-B6I/AAAAAAAABMg/dd4ADNAEevY/s800/DSCF0411.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  The snow didn't slow me down too much, because I was on a mission to
  get to the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  I hit a shelter full of people
  at about 5 pm with about 7 miles left to go before I got there.  I
  didn't even hesitate about staying at the shelter.  I knew that if I
  was going to make it to the end by my birthday, I would have to do
  the miles that night.
</p>
<p>
  I eventually did make it to the outdoor center, after a little bit
  of night-hiking.  I am almost always against the idea of
  night-hiking, but it really is magical in the snow: everywhere that
  your headlamp hits just sparkles.  I was really glad to be inside
  that night &ndash; it snowed more and got quite cold outside and I was
  snug inside.
</p>
<p>
  The next morning was still cold, so I went and bought a cap at the
  outfitter.  It was a good thing that I did too, because I was cold
  almost all of that day.  That night it got the coldest that it ever
  was on the trail.  My sleeping bag, rated at 0 C (meaning that
  I should be comfortable all the way down to that temperature) was
  really not warm enough.  I slept in all my clothes and had just my
  nose poking out the top.  It was cold.
</p>
<p>
  Thankfully, that was the coldest night that I spent on the trail.
  The sun came out the next day and never went away again.  I passed
  the point where I only had 100 miles left and at that point I was
  pretty certain that I would make it.  I had 4 days left until my
  birthday, and I was also pretty certain that I would make it by
  then.  Thinking back to the beginning of my hike, that would have
  been hubris, but now that I had gotten near the end, it really was
  justified confidence.  That said, there were some tests to come, but
  no more in North Carolina, because I was almost out of there.
