<h2 id="sec-1">Major progress </h2>

<p>
  Now I am able to write wikilinks to images on the local server and
  not just hosted remotely.  For example,
  <a href="./posts/time-series-2/interest-rates.png"><img src="posts/time-series-2/interest-rates.png" alt="interest-rates.png"/></a> is an image that I wanted to show
  at the end of <a href="./posts/time-series-2">the article on my time-series framework</a>, but which I
  couldn't because the org plugin wasn't able to show images at the
  time.
</p>
<p>
  Another bit of progress is that I finally debugged the little shell
  shim to allow it to start up the emacs daemon properly.  Now I can
  just have one emacs window running and one emacs daemon in the
  background.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Remaining TODOs </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  The remaining work left to do should not be too difficult.  I have
  some of my own org customization baked into the file which would be
  better left up to the user's preferences.  I have to decide whether
  it makes more sense for the user to customize these preferences in
  the ikiwiki configuration file or just in their <code>.emacs</code>.  The
  latter would be easier for me, but it might be easier for the user
  (especially if they have multiple wikis set up) to do it in the
  ikiwiki configuration file.
</p>
<p>
  I also need to allow for verbatim inclusion of links.  I guess it
  makes more sense to do this in the standard org manner rather than
  the ikiwiki manner (with a backslash in front of the link).
  However, the link must be protected from ikiwiki interpreting it, so
  things might get a little complex there.
</p>
<p>
  After those two things are completed, however, I think I'm going to
  call this project done unless I hear feedback from users.

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">More fun with emacs </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  Lately, I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Anything">anything.el</a>, which has been
  described as "Quicksilver for emacs".  I've played around with it
  before, but have had a hard time changing my habits so that it's the
  first thing I think of doing when changing buffers or finding
  files.  The main reason, I think, is that <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IswitchBuffers">iswitch</a> is usually just as
  fast.
</p>
<p>
  However, I have started using <a href="./posts/git-annex">git annex</a> to store my music and
  videos, and that has added some complexity to the way that I deal
  with them.  My usual flow is to do a <code>git annex find</code> to see what
  files I have on my laptop, after which I play one of them with
  <code>smplayer</code>.  When I am done with the file, I either use <code>git annex   drop</code> or <code>git annex move</code> to get rid of the file from my laptop.
</p>
<p>
  All of that takes a lot of typing in the shell, so I wondered
  whether I could speed it up using <code>anything</code>.  If you guessed that I
  could (given that I am writing this article), give yourself a gold
  star.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">How I did it </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  <code>anything</code> is highly extensible.  Anyone can define their own setup
  with a command like this:
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun my-anything ()
  (interactive)
  (anything-other-buffer
   '(anything-c-source-buffers+
     anything-c-source-recentf
     anything-c-source-files-in-current-dir+
     anything-c-source-git-annex
     anything-c-source-org-headline
     anything-c-source-bookmarks
     anything-c-source-bookmark-set
     anything-c-source-emms-files)
    "*anything*"))
</pre>




<p>
  which is just a function that tells <code>anything</code> to use a bunch of
  different "sources" as possible interesting things that you might
  want to interact with.  For example, <code>anything-c-source-recentf</code>
  gives a list of files that you recently had open.  That comes with
  the <code>anything</code> package, though, so it's not too interesting from our
  point of view.  What is interesting is
  <code>anything-c-source-git-annex</code>.  It looks like this:
</p>



<pre class="example">(defvar anything-c-source-git-annex
  '((name . "Git Annex")
    (candidates . (lambda ()
                    (with-current-buffer anything-current-buffer
                     (with-temp-buffer
                       (call-process "git" nil t nil "annex" "find")
                       (goto-char (point-min))
                       (split-string (buffer-string) "\n")))))
    (volatile)
    (action . (("Watch" . anything-c-git-annex-play)
               ("Drop" . anything-c-git-annex-drop)
               ("Move" . anything-c-git-annex-move)
               ("Copy" . anything-c-git-annex-copy)))))
</pre>




<p>
  It should hopefully be fairly easy to understand.  There are two
  interesting parts: getting candidate files, and the actions on the
  candidate files.  Getting the candidate files is as simple as
  putting the results of <code>git annex find</code> into a temporary buffer
  (which must be in the same directory as the current buffer) and then
  putting the lines of the buffer into a list.  (This wouldn't work if
  the file names contained newlines, but I don't have any of those.
  If you wanted to be really careful, you could add the "&ndash;print0"
  option to <code>call-process</code> and split the string on "\0".)
</p>
<p>
  The actions are all functions.  The simplest is
  <code>anything-c-git-annex-drop</code>, which just looks like
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun anything-c-git-annex-drop (candidate)
  (anything-git-annex-command "drop" (concat "\"" candidate "\"")))
</pre>




<p>
  where <code>anything-git-annex-command</code> just starts a shell command.
  More interesting is <code>anything-c-git-annex-copy</code>, which is defined as
  follows
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun anything-c-git-annex-copy (candidate)
  (let* ((to (anything-comp-read
              "To Git Annex: "
              (anything-c-git-remotes)
              :must-match nil)))
    (anything-git-annex-command "copy" (concat "\"" candidate "\"")
                                "--to" (concat "\"" to "\""))))

(defun anything-c-git-remotes ()
  (with-temp-buffer
    (call-process "git" nil (current-buffer) nil "remote")
    (delete "" (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))))
</pre>




<p>
  The <code>anything-c-git-annex-copy</code> command needs to know to which
  repository it should copy the candidate that has been selected.  I
  find out which one I want to copy to by listing the remotes that are
  known about by the git repository that the file is in.  Using
  <code>anything-comp-read</code> means that the remotes are listed in the same
  style all of the <code>anything</code> candidates are listed in.  It's pretty
  nice, because it keeps me in the same mode of operation as before.
</p>

<p>
  It's a bit hard to write about what makes <code>anything.el</code> an
  interesting way of doing things in emacs &ndash; a screencast might be
  more helpful &ndash; but I hope some of the power is evident from this
  little writeup.  I'm going to try to train myself to use <code>anything</code>
  more often.  We'll see how it goes.

<a href="./posts/org-ikiwiki-plugin-3/">Lessons learned (so far) from the ikiwiki plugin</a>

</span>
</div>

<div class="inlinecontent">

<p>Writing my <a href="./posts/org-ikiwiki-plugin">new plugin</a> in Emacs Lisp, I learned a few things.  Here are
some of them, in no particular order.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">xml-rpc.el has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  I don't mean to be unkind here.  xml-rpc.el seems pretty good if you
  are doing exactly one kind of thing: calling a method on a server
  that can be reached by http.  For anything else, it is very hard to
  use.   My plugin has the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be called by another program through xml-rpc.
</li>
<li>It must read from and write to files (and not http).
</li>
</ul>


<p>    
  Neither of these things is made easy with xml-rpc.  The first I can
  understand &ndash; xml-rpc would have to somehow insinuate itself into
  the emacs event loop and watch for calls all the time.  The second
  is less easy to understand.  Parsing xml-rpc is not really related
  to reading from http.  So why are the two things tied together?  In
  my opinion, xml-rpc.el would be a much nicer library if parsing the
  xml-rpc was separated completely from the http stuff.  There could
  be convenience functions, but they would be a layer of abstraction
  on top of the other two layers.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">xml.el has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  There isn't a function to get a list of all nodes with a given name?
  Are you kidding me?  Here is my implementation, but I bet there is a
  better one somewhere:
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun xml-find-nodes-matching (node name)
  "Returns all children of `node' that have an `xml-node-name' equal to `name'."
  (if (or (eq node '()) (not (listp node)))
      '()
    (if (equal (xml-node-name node) name)
        (cons node (delq nil (mapcar (lambda (nd) (xml-find-nodes-matching nd name)) (xml-node-children node))))
      (delq nil (apply 'append (mapcar (lambda (nd) (xml-find-nodes-matching nd name)) (xml-node-children node)))))))
</pre>




<p>
  In general, both xml-rpc.el and xml.el use a distressing number of
  calls to <code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code>, and <code>cdaddr</code> (and all the versions in
  between).  
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Perl has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  Ikiwiki sends named parameters as an even-lengthed xml-rpc array
  rather than as an xml-rpc struct.  This is because not all of the
  functions that can be called via xml-rpc take named parameters and I
  guess Perl isn't smart enough to tell a hash from an even-lengthed
  array.  This isn't a huge problem, but it does mean that I need to
  convert the input to each of the functions that I write into a hash
  before I use it.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Ikiwiki has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
  I would like to be able to ignore files that don't have a particular
  extension.  For <code>htmlify</code>, this is the way it works by default.  It
  seems like most of the functions that plugins can implement are not
  this way by default, though, and that is a shame.  If the plugin is
  not external &ndash; that is, it is written in Perl &ndash; there is really no
  problem.  The function is called, checks the extension of the source
  file, and returns without doing anything.  However, when the plugin
  is external and the call must happen through xml-rpc, ikiwiki must
  transmit the data via xml-rpc and receive the returned data back via
  xml-rpc.  Unnecessary calls take a lot longer in that context.
</p>
<p>
  So I would like for most calls to <code>hook</code> to take an optional
  <code>extension</code> parameter that takes an extension (or even better, a
  regexp), and only call the function if the file name has the same
  extension (or matches the regexp).

<h2 id="sec-5">Working with emacs buffers is pretty nice </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
  Does a function that you're trying to write in emacs lisp give you a
  string?  It's pretty easy to throw it in a temporary buffer and then
  tell emacs to do the things that you would normally do while you
  were editing in order to get the proper information out of the
  string.  The <code>with-temporary-buffer</code> macro makes it especially easy
  to do just that.

<h2 id="sec-6">Getting info from a structured list is easier to do as a recursive function </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
  One of the things that took me the longest was to figure out what
  this couple of lines of code was doing:
</p>



<pre class="example">(setq valtype (car (caddar xml-list))
      valvalue (caddr (caddar xml-list)))  
</pre>




<p>
  What should the value of <code>xml-list</code> look like in order to get the
  correct thing out of it?  It turned out that I needed to take the
  <code>cdr</code> of the <code>cdaddr</code> of the <code>caddar</code> of the parsed xml in order to
  get the correct value.  That only worked when ikiwiki was responding
  to a method call, though.  I had a much easier time getting the
  right values out when I simply started using the
  <code>xml-find-nodes-matching</code> function that I showed above.
</p>
<p>
  When you see yourself writing more than a few <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code> calls
  in a row (or <code>first</code>, <code>rest</code>, or <code>nth</code> calls in Clojure), stop and
  try to write a function that finds what you are looking for.  The
  function doesn't have to be recursive, but that might be the easiest
  way to do it.

<div id="outline-container-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">It's nice when all calls and responses are dumped to a file </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">


<p>
  In a sense, this is just saying that code can be easier to debug if
  you're tracing it.  But since the calls between ikiwiki and the
  plugin must go through files anyway, we get the program traced
  automatically.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>  
  Progress on the <a href="./posts/org-ikiwiki-plugin">plugin</a> is proceeding apace.  In fact, the link in the
  last sentence is a major milestone &ndash; for the first time, I can use
  what ikiwiki calls <a href="http://ikiwiki.info/ikiwiki/wikilink/">wikilinks</a>.  What would happen previously is that
  ikiwiki would stick some raw HTML into an org file when it thought
  it saw a wikilink.  Org wouldn't know what to do with this, and
  would escape the HTML so that it would show up in the browser.  This
  is the reason that I couldn't include images in the posts &ndash; they
  would get interpreted as wikilinks and then org would choke on the
  resulting HTML.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure that inserting local picture files works yet, but
  inserting pictures from other servers works okay.  For example, here
  is a picture of me standing at the US/Mexico border:
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JiFi6diO5zM/Tgziytt-fwI/AAAAAAAACDc/dQXeYi-7odI/s144/DSCF0494.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JiFi6diO5zM/Tgziytt-fwI/AAAAAAAACDc/dQXeYi-7odI/s144/DSCF0494.JPG" />
  and here is me after hiking to the US/Canada border:
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j-b_h7_SSlo/TnyPfTGVCyI/AAAAAAAADWA/cFvVuP1QvB8/s144/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-j-b_h7_SSlo/TnyPfTGVCyI/AAAAAAAADWA/cFvVuP1QvB8/s144/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  I think I have ironed out most of the kinks that caused things to
  hang previously when updating the site, but more testing is
  certainly needed.  Things that remain on my todo list include
  figuring out why it doesn't work when the emacs doing the compiling
  is daemonized, and testing whether locally hosted pictures work.
</p>
<p>
  Any feedback would be appreciated!

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Probably a bad idea&hellip; </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  File this one in the category of crazy ideas had while running.  I
  was thinking about my new org-mode plugin that I announced <a href="http://chrismgray.github.com/posts/org-ikiwiki-plugin/">yesterday</a>
  and how hard it is to write in Emacs Lisp.  I was wishing that I
  could write it in Clojure instead.  Now, they're not <b>such</b>
  different languages &ndash; they both are evolutions of McCarthy's
  original lisp, but Clojure is a much prettier, less crufty
  language.
</p>
<p>
  Let's look at just one construct in both languages: <code>let</code>.  In both
  languages, this assigns values to variable names locally. In elisp,
  it looks like:
</p>



<pre class="example">(let* ((foo bar)
       (baz foo)))
</pre>




<p>
  Instead of calling <code>let</code> there, I had to call <code>let*</code>, so that the
  results of the first assignment were known to the second assignment.
  There is also a lot of parentheses there.  (Unparenthesized
  variables become automatically initialized to <code>nil</code> I believe.  I
  don't think that's a great idea.)  Contrast this with Clojure's
  <code>let</code>.
</p>



<pre class="example">(let [foo bar
      baz foo])
</pre>




<p>
  To me, that's much more readable.
</p>
<p>
  Clojure's core libraries are also much more readable than most of
  elisp.  It seems to me that elisp was designed in the days where
  computer usage was charged by the letter and has not been updated
  since.  (Don't get me wrong &ndash; I love Emacs and would rather program
  in elisp than Perl, but it has some warts.)
</p>

</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Maybe not so crazy </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  Emacs already has a reader that can be used to turn lispy-looking
  things into lispy data structures.  Add some macros on top of that
  and you might be able to produce a <code>def</code> that's equivalent to
  Clojure's.  Since much of Clojure is written in Clojure (and all of
  Clojurescript is), defining the Clojure functions might just be a
  hop, skip, and jump away from that.
</p>
<p>
  Clojure could intern symbols into emacs (with namespaces prepended)
  and then emacs could use them.  Clojure could also call emacs
  functions directly &ndash; any symbol that isn't defined in a Clojure
  namespace would be tested to see if it exists in emacs.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Probably pretty crazy after all </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  One of Clojure's big selling points is its concurrency semantics.
  I don't follow emacs development very closely, but I don't think
  emacs is going to support any of that any time soon.  Also, would it
  be possible to compile the new language to elisp bytecode?  How
  would <code>recur</code> work?
</p>
<p>
  There are a lot of questions, and here I am working on a plugin for
  a combination of tools that hardly anyone uses.  But everyone has to
  scratch their own itch as they say.

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Totally crazy </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
  <b>Update:</b> As I suspected, this idea won't work: elisp doesn't have
  reader macros, so the difference in read syntaxes of clojure and
  elisp would be impossible to express to the elisp reader.  Maybe one
  could write a parser in elisp, but that would probably be slow and
  hard to do.  The idea was only attractive when large parts were
  already done.

<h2 id="sec-1">Convex Hulls Three Ways </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  Whenever I watch cooking competition shows, they always have chefs
  presenting a foodstuff cooked in multiple different ways.  Today,
  I'm doing that with algorithms.
</p>
<p>
  The algorithm in question today is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">convex hull</a> algorithm.  In
  order of implementation complexity, and descending order of
  theoretical running time, there is the Jarvis March, Graham's Scan,
  and Chan's Algorithm.  All three are implemented in Clojure in my
  <a href="https://github.com/chrismgray/convex-hull">github repository</a>.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Jarvis March </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
   The simplest of the algorithms, the Jarvis March was also one of
   the first output-sensitive computational geometry algorithms.  In a
   nutshell, you first find a point that you know to be on the convex
   hull, and then you find the next point by looking at all the rest
   of the points and determining which one has a segment that has the
   property that all the rest of the points are on one side of it.
   You repeatedly find the next point using this procedure until you
   get back to the first point.  There is basically no way to
   implement this algorithm that does not have a running time of
   \(O(hn)\), where \(h\) is the number of points on the convex hull
   and \(n\) is the number of input points.
</p>
<p>
   The one implementation detail of the Jarvis March that is
   interesting is that whenever you see the concept of "finding the
   next thing" given some previous information, the Clojure
   implementation should almost always be lazy.  It turns out that
   implementing Jarvis March lazily will help in implementing Chan's
   Algorithm, so keep that in mind.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Graham's Scan </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">


<p>
   Graham's Scan is one of the algorithms I remember most vividly from
   the undergraduate computational geometry course that I took.  The
   professor, Godfried Toussaint, always referred to it as the "three
   coins" algorithm, so I have kept up that tradition in some of my
   function names in my implementation.
</p>
<p>
   The algorithm first makes a polygon of the input points by sorting
   them by angle about the bottom-most point.  Then it goes around the
   polygon with a stack, pushing and popping points as it goes.  If
   that sounds familiar, it should &ndash; it's the same idea as what I was
   talking about when I brought up the idea of <a href="http://chrismgray.github.com/posts/parsing-polygons/">parsing polygons</a> a week
   and a half ago. 
</p>
<p>
   Thus, I used the same polygon-parsing monad in my implementation as
   when I computed the visibility polygons last week.  It still works
   just as well.
</p>
<p>
   Since the points must be sorted, Graham's Scan takes \(\Theta(n
   \log n)\).  Sorting can be reduced to computing convex hulls, so
   computing convex hulls has a \(\Omega(n \log n)\) lower bound,
   meaning that this algorithm is optimal.
</p>
<p>
   But Chan's algorithm is better.  Weird huh?
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3">Chan's Algorithm </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">


<p>
   I must confess that I had always been a little intimidated by
   Chan's Algorithm.  It was invented by Timothy Chan, who has a
   well-earned reputation for being a genius, so I thought it would be
   really complicated.  It's not.  There is a decent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan's_algorithm">description</a> of it
   on Wikipedia, so I won't go into the details.  The gist is that you
   combine the two previous algorithms that I discussed.  The Jarvis
   March needs to be modified so that the points can be input as a
   list of smaller convex hulls, and the next point on the convex hull
   is found by doing a binary search on the smaller convex hulls.  But
   that is really the hardest part about the algorithm.  I have put
   the whole thing below, because I think it's pretty beautiful.
</p>



<pre class="example">(defn chans-algorithm
  "Finds the convex hull of a set of points by
   the algorithm known as 'Chan's Algorithm'."
  [pts]
  (let [bottom-pt (apply min-key :y pts)]
   (loop [m 3] ; start out with triangles
     (let [partitioned-pts (partition m m [] pts)
           c-hs (map grahams-scan partitioned-pts)
           potential-ch (take m (apply jarvis-march pts c-hs))]
       (if (= bottom-pt (last potential-ch)) ; assumes jarvis-march returns bottom-pt last
         potential-ch
         (recur (min (* m m) (count pts))))))))
</pre>




<p>
   The great thing about Chan's Algorithm is that it is also
   output-sensitive.  But instead of being \(O(nh)\) (which is
   \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case), it is \(O(n \log h)\), which is at
   least as good as Graham's Scan, but often better.  It is also quite
   simple to implement, given decent implementations of Jarvis March
   and Graham's Scan.  
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Conclusion </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  Convex hull algorithms are great.  If I was ever to teach a
  computational geometry course (admittedly that's looking like a long
  shot now), I might start and finish the course with them.  The
  progression from the ultra-simple Jarvis March to the
  more-complicated Chan's Algorithm is really nice, and there are
  interesting new things to talk about the whole way.  They also show
  that computational geometry is not so hard to do in a functional
  style.  In fact, using laziness is what makes the implementation of
  Chan's Algorithm so simple.  So this might make a nice talk to give
  people who are already into functional programming as well.
</p>
<p>
  The next thing I have in mind for this project is to animate the
  algorithms.  Viewing the output of algorithms is already pretty easy
  using Processing, but I would like to be able to see them as they
  are operating.  It would be great if I could do that without
  changing the code too much.  I have a couple of ideas, but I'm not
  sure if they'll work yet.
</p>
<p>
  Also, it is slightly embarrassing to admit, but my blogging system
  seems to not support putting images in posts.  So I am going to have
  to figure out how to work around (or even fix) that before I can
  show any results.

<h2 id="sec-1">Leaving Monson </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  When I last left my hiking tale, Picker, Grinner, Frosty and I had
  just gotten to Monson in time for breakfast.  We were hustled into
  showers and given clean clothes to put on while ours were in the
  washer.  We decided to stay in Monson for the rest of the day.  A
  bit of hiking terminology: a <i>zero</i> is a day in which no walking is
  done.  What we were doing is called a <i>nearo</i> (sometimes written
  <i>near-0</i>), short for near-zero.  It's one of the most enjoyable ways
  to spend a day.  You only need to pay for one night at the hostel or
  hotel, but you have all the fun of a town day.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, breakfast was great &ndash; unlimited pancakes, eggs, and some of
  the best home fries I had on the trail.  The big event of the day
  was the World Cup final.  The town of Monson is extremely small.
  There was one bar and one convenience store as well as the hostel we
  were staying at, named Shaw's.  We watched the final at the bar.  I
  was disappointed that the Netherlands lost, but I remember it being
  a really dirty game, so I guess the better team won in the end.
</p>
<p>
  Frosty got a six-pack of beer for us to split, and it was through
  this beer that we met Wounded Knee.  The four of us had taken a seat
  to chat and drink the beer, when Wounded Knee showed up with one of
  the beers in his hand.  He began regaling us with hiking stories and
  bad jokes.  Later, we figured that he probably thought he was paying
  for the beer by telling us his great stories.  I think we would have
  been happier if he had just taken the beer and left us alone.
  (Cruel, but true &ndash; at least he did provide an excellent topic of
  conversation over the next month.)
</p>
<p>
  After a rather fitful sleep, Picker, Grinner, and I left Frosty in
  Monson.  He wanted to stay another day to rest after the 100-mile
  wilderness.  Unfortunately, it was the last time we would see him on
  our hike &ndash; he got a stress fracture in his foot and stopped about
  50 miles later.
</p>
<p>
  As we were being driven back to the trail, we were given a warning
  about a "bahd hikeah" (a bad hiker in the heavy Northeastern accent
  that is common in Maine).  He had apparently chosen to swim a
  dangerous river for which a ferry is provided after heaping abuse on
  the ferry operator.  He would not be served in Monson &ndash; my first
  hint that there is a little network of hostel operators up and down
  the trail.  We actually did cross paths with the guy, and he looked
  more like a motorcycle enthusiast than a hiker, but other than that,
  there was no indication that he was really a bad guy.
</p>
<p>
  The next day, Grinner was not feeling great.  I think it was for
  this reason that we did not go very far.  On the subsequent day, it
  became clear that Grinner was really sick.  Luckily, they had a cell
  phone with them, and were able to call Shaw's.  Grinner was picked
  up, and as she left, she told me to take care of Picker.  Which
  showed that she hadn't lost her sense of humor, because Picker is a
  bad-ass Army veteran who had been in Iraq.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  Picker was obviously concerned about his wife, so we made a plan to
  get to the next town as quickly as possible.  We got to the Kennebec
  river (the one with the ferry) unfortunately after the ferry had
  stopped for the night.  Partly to give myself something to do, and
  partly to cheer Picker up, I decided to find us some sodas.  The
  small town of Caratunk is near the trail at that point, but it
  didn't even have a convenience store, so I had to hitchhike to a
  small resort that had vending machines.  It was my first time
  hitching a ride, and I was glad that it worked out well.
</p>
<p>
  The next day, we caught the first ferry across the river.  When one
  imagines a ferry, it is usually a fairly large boat.  This was not.
  It was a small canoe, operated by a local hippie.  I helped row us
  across the river, and we set out as fast as possible.  That was our
  first twenty-mile day.  The scenery was great, with a nice waterfall
  near the trail, but we were in a rush to see Grinner again.  Near
  the end of the day, the trail was rerouted, adding an extra couple
  of miles to our day.  We were quite glad to get to the campsite on
  the North side of Little Bigelow Mountain.
</p>
<p>
  This put us only about 15 miles from Stratton, where we assumed that
  Grinner would be.  However, there were two big climbs between here
  and there.  We must have gotten to the top of the first fairly early
  in the morning.  We crossed a road in which someone had <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/2Qwgtnn5g3HJZgZp52HULHIQdffm0dM4kWIdDklkn2s?feat=directlink">painted</a>
  "2000 mi.", meaning that we still had two thousand miles to go --
  even after almost two weeks of hiking.
</p>
<p>
  When we got to the camp site five miles from Stratton, there was a
  decision to make.  We had done 10 miles, but it had been 10 hard
  miles.  The rest of the way to the road would be all downhill, and
  there would be no more camping possibilities.  Picker left the
  decision up to me, but I could tell that he really wanted to go on.
  After a rest for my back (which still hadn't gotten as strong as
  would get), I decided that we should try to get to the road.  We
  also talked to a northbounder who said that the trail was pretty
  easy and that we could make it.  At that point, I had not learned to
  mistrust everything northbounders say.
</p>

  I would have done well to mistrust the northbounder.  The descent
  was really difficult.  However, I did see a <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/bBFYuVIz4Xp42kq3LKPhEHIQdffm0dM4kWIdDklkn2s?feat=directlink">beaver</a>, so that made it
  kind of worth it.  When we got within two miles of the road, Picker
  started running.  I trotted along behind him, and we got to the road
  within thirty minutes.  We called the Stratton motel and were
  heartened to find that Grinner was already there.  She was feeling
  better, which was a huge relief.

<h2 id="sec-3">Stratton </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  Since we had gone faster than expected between Monson and Stratton,
  and since Grinner still wasn't 100%, I decided to take an actual
  zero in Stratton.  I got a ride to Rangeley to get some better shoes
  and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q1P0K2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B001Q1P0K2">hiking poles</a> at the outfitter there.  I still have those poles
  after more than 4000 miles, so I feel comfortable recommending
  them.
</p>
<p>
  The other big event from our zero day in Stratton is that we found a
  lady that was selling pies from her house.  She didn't have the
  proper food license to sell slices, so we were forced to buy a whole
  cheesecake.  We had no choice in the matter.  I think we showed
  great restraint by not eating the entire cheesecake in one sitting
  &ndash; we saved some for breakfast the next day.
</p>
<p>
  Oh, and one final story from Stratton.  We had caught up to Wounded
  Knee by getting there a day earlier than scheduled.  During
  conversation, he mentioned that he had an injury that he needed some
  help putting a bandage on.  Somehow, I was volunteered to help him
  out.  It turned out that he had a really bad chafe on his bum and
  couldn't quite see it to put the bandage on himself.  So I got to
  help out with that.  Blech.

<p>
  In a job interview last week I said a couple of things related to
  sorting in Clojure that turned out to be incorrect when I checked
  them.  This is my way of making up for them &ndash; if I can make them
  true, then no one will notice.  Though to be fair, I'm sure that I'm
  the only one that thinks that way.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing I said was that heap-sort is my favorite sorting
  algorithm, but then I declined to implement it, preferring to
  implement merge-sort instead.  I think this is actually pretty
  reasonable in an interview situation &ndash; heap-sort is a conceptually
  more difficult sorting algorithm, so being able to remember it on
  the spot is more difficult.  The second thing I said was that
  Clojure itself uses heap-sort and that given its love affair with
  laziness that it would not be unreasonable to assume that <code>(first   (sort lst))</code> was a linear-time operation.  I might have read
  something like this on a mailing list or IRC, but it is not
  correct.  Clojure currently uses Java's <code>sort</code> function, which is a
  slightly-modified merge-sort.  There is not much point in making
  that algorithm lazy, because getting the first element from the
  sorted list requires \(O(n \log n)\) time anyway.

<h2 id="sec-2">Heap Sort </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  For those that are not familiar with it, heap-sort is something that
  is usually taught in a second-year undergraduate Computer Science
  class.  So it's not <b>that</b> difficult an algorithm, but it does
  require some thinking, and there is some fancy analysis that goes
  into part of it.  For a full discussion, see the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0262033844">Introduction to Algorithms</a> book by Cormen, Lieserson, Rivest, and Stein.

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Heap </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
   To start with, a <i>heap</i> is conceptually a tree where values are
   stored at the nodes.  The largest value of all the values stored in
   subtrees is stored at the root and the two descendant trees are
   heaps.  Heaps are usually required to be as close to balanced as
   possible &ndash; if any level of the tree has leaves, they are all
   bunched to the right, and all the rest of the leaves are at the
   next level.
</p>
<p>
   Such a tree is usually implemented as an array, where the child
   nodes of a node can be obtained by some simple arithmetic on the
   index of the node in the array.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Building a Heap </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
   Given the definition, there is an intuitive algorithm for building
   such a heap on a set of numbers: first find the largest number in
   your set and have it be the root of the heap, then split the rest
   of the numbers in half, and recursively make heaps on those sets.
</p>
<p>
   Such an algorithm is clearly correct, but it is also clearly
   \(\Theta(n \log n)\).  We can do better with a bottom-up algorithm.
   If we continue imagining the heap as a tree, we start by putting
   the input numbers into the tree willy-nilly.  This clearly does not
   satisfy the heap properties laid out above.  However, some of it
   does satisfy the heap properties &ndash; the leaves of the tree are
   trivially heaps.  If we go up one level from the leaves, we can fix
   the trees rooted there by exchanging the root of the tree with its
   largest child (or not exchanging it if it's already the largest of
   the three).  Higher levels are a bit more difficult, because if the
   root of a tree is exchanged, then we must make sure to fix the tree
   that it ends up being the root of.  You can imagine the root of a
   tree traveling down the heap until it is larger than both of its
   children.
</p>
<p>
   The correctness of this algorithm is a bit harder to see and it
   also appears to take \(O(n \log n)\) time.  It does, but there is a
   slightly more sophisticated analysis that shows that it is really
   \(\Theta(n)\).  I won't go into the analysis, but a hint is that
   most of the values don't actually travel very far in the tree.  
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">Using a heap to sort </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">


<p>
   With the heap properties in mind, we can easily see how to get the
   largest value of a set of numbers &ndash; just take the top element from
   the heap.  How can we use the heap properties to sort?  Well, we
   want the largest number, then the largest number that remains, then
   the largest number that remains after that, and so on.  So if we
   can take the largest number from the heap and then fix the heap so
   that it retains the heap properties, then we'd be done.
</p>
<p>
   We just devised a way to fix heaps when building the heap, so we
   use that.  What we do is to take the very last node in the heap
   (which is not necessarily the smallest, but it doesn't hurt to
   think about it as the smallest) and put that at the top of the
   heap.  The resulting tree is clearly not a heap, but if we call the
   algorithm to fix heaps on the root of the tree, then we end up with
   a heap again.  The node that we put on top of the heap might end up
   traveling all the way to the bottom, so this update takes
   \(\Theta(\log n)\) time.  Thus if we sort the entire input set, we
   have a \(\Theta(n \log n)\) algorithm.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">Advantages </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">


<p>
   That's the best we can do theoretically, which is great, but the
   Java <code>sort</code> algorithm is also \(\Theta(n \log n)\), so why is there
   any advantage to using heap-sort?  In a language where laziness is
   embraced (such as Clojure), heap-sort can be made lazy.  That is,
   the next element of the sorted list can be computed only when it is
   needed.  Since the build-heap procedure described above takes
   linear time, getting the first element from the sorted list takes
   \(O(n)\) time.  Each subsequent element then takes \(O(\log n)\)
   time.  Thus, if only a small number of elements from the sorted
   list are needed, then this lazy version of heap-sort is
   theoretically faster than other sorts.
</p>
<p>
   I can think of situations where this would actually have practical
   advantages.  For example, what if you were writing a search engine
   and wanted to obtain the \(k\) best results?  You could write an
   ad-hoc function that found the best result, removed it and recursed
   \(k - 1\) times.  Or you could just <code>(take k (heap-sort input))</code>.
   The first would take \(O(kn)\) time, whereas the second would take
   \(O(k \log n + n)\) time.  In many practical situations, \(k\) is
   \(\Omega(\log n)\), which means that the first takes \(\Omega(n
   \log n)\) time, whereas the second takes only \(O(n)\) time.
   Essentially, the first is no better than the second solution with a
   non-lazy sorting algorithm.

<div id="outline-container-2-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-5">Disadvantages </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5">


<p>
   Heap-sort has some disadvantages compared to other sorts of <code>sort</code>
   algorithms.  The least theoretically significant is that the
   constants hidden in the big-O notation are higher than other
   sorting algorithms (tuned versions of quicksort can have extremely
   small constants).
</p>
<p>
   Another disadvantage can be seen when dealing with data sets so
   large that they no longer fit in the computer's main memory.
   Something like merge-sort can be modified fairly easily so that the
   number I/O operations is minimized.  I haven't thought about it too
   deeply, but this doesn't seem quite so easy with heap-sort.
   However, I think that people dealing with such large datasets
   should probably be using specialized libraries anyway, so perhaps
   that isn't too bad.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Implementation </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  This whole discussion is a bit useless if it only remains at the
  theoretical level.  I have an implementation <a href="https://github.com/chrismgray/clojure-heap-sort">in my github repo</a> that
  implements most of the ideas that are given above.  The code is
  highly optimized so that it is somewhat competitive with the native
  Java implementation.  This makes the code on the HEAD of the
  <code>master</code> branch somewhat less than readable.  However, the first
  commit to the repository used Clojure vectors and a functional
  style, so if you would like to understand the code, you might start
  there. 
</p>
<p>
  I (unfortunately) needed to use Java arrays and mutation rather than
  the more functional style that I have gotten used to, but the
  results speak for themselves.  Finding the first few elements of a
  sorted array is significantly faster than the Java version.  Finding
  the entire sorted list is somewhat slower than the Java version, but
  not too much.  This is not surprising for a couple of reasons.
  First, heap-sort tends to have larger constants than other sorting
  methods.  Secondly, this code is one day old.  The Java sort method
  has had years to be optimized.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Conclusion </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
  It may be dreaming, but I would love to see this idea (if not this
  implementation) put into Clojure proper.  I think the advantages
  from laziness outweigh the small constant slowdown versus using
  Java's <code>sort</code>.

<h2 id="sec-1">Using git annex </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  I remember being a young pup using Debian and reading the mailing
  lists.  I was always seeing the name <a href="http://joey.kitenet.net/blog/">Joey Hess</a> answering the tough
  questions.  I had great respect for him then, and it has remained to
  this day.  I have probably used his <code>unclutter</code> program for ten
  years and it has never crashed.  I recently installed <code>ikiwiki</code> to
  run this blog, <code>etckeeper</code> to track changes in my config files, and
  I figured that I should try his other recent software: <code>git-annex</code>.
</p>
<p>
  I came at it with two objectives: to be able to sync my podcasts and
  to be able to manage my media files better.  The second has worked
  really well, and the first <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/forum/Podcast_syncing_use-case/">is hopefully getting there soon</a>.  I will
  concentrate on the second for the moment, since that is what I have
  working the best.  There are multiple use-cases described on
  <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com">git-annex's website</a> &ndash; I will just go through mine.
</p>
<p>
  All of my media files are on a terabyte external drive.  When I am
  at home, I have it mounted as an NFS drive on <code>/media/mybook</code>.  I
  have videos there, split into <code>tv</code> and <code>movies</code> folders, as well as
  music in the <code>music</code> folder.  All of the folders are treated the
  same, so I will just go through the procedure I used in the <code>music</code>
  folder.
</p>
<p>
  First, I set up the annex:
</p>



<pre class="example">~ $ cd /media/mybook/music
/media/mybook/music $ git init .
/media/mybook/music $ git annex init mybook-music
/media/mybook/music $ emacs .git/config
</pre>



<p>
  at this point, I set the <code>backends</code> keyword in the <code>[annex]</code> section
  to either <code>SHA1E</code> or <code>SHA256E</code>.  There is a tradeoff there between
  speed and safety &ndash; it is a bit more likely that two files hash to
  the same file with <code>SHA1E</code>, but it is faster than <code>SHA256E</code>.  The
  <code>E</code> at the end of the hash means that the filename extension is
  preserved in the hashing.  This is important for some mp3 players
  and other programs that can not tell what type a file is without an
  extension.  The next command takes a long time with a lot of files:
</p>



<pre class="example">/media/mybook/music $ git annex add .
[All the files are hashed and their contents are put into .git/annex]
[You will see that all your files are now symlinks to files in .git/annex]
/media/mybook/music $ git commit -m "Added my files"
</pre>



<p>
  Now it is possible to clone this repository back on the laptop
</p>



<pre class="example">~ $ git clone /media/mybook/music
~ $ cd music
~/music $ git annex init laptop-music
~/music $ git remote add mybook-music /media/mybook/music
~/music $ cd /media/mybook/music
/media/mybook/music $ git remote add laptop-music ~/music
</pre>



<p>
  And now all of the cool stuff can begin.  You can look inside the
  <code>~/music</code> directory and see that it appears that all your files are
  there.  However, they are not taking up any space.  What is
  happening is that they are broken symlinks to objects in
  <code>~/music/.git/annex</code>.  If I want to listen to some of the music, I
  move it over to the laptop with the following command
</p>



<pre class="example">~/music $ git annex get --from mybook-music Beatles/
</pre>



<p>
  I can now take my laptop on the plane and listen to the Beatles.
  When I'm back from my trip, I can free up the space by doing
</p>



<pre class="example">~/music $ git annex drop Beatles/
</pre>



<p>
  Suppose I obtain some new music, getting into the Rolling Stones.
  Then I can use <code>git annex add</code> to add the Stones into my collection,
  <code>git commit</code> them and <code>git pull</code> in the correct repository to
  duplicate the information.  I can then use <code>git annex copy</code> or <code>git   annex move</code> to put the files where I want them.
</p>
<p>
  For now, I have a queue of unseen videos and music that I want to
  hear on my laptop, while the bulk of my media collection sits on my
  external drive.  I can take what I want with me and not worry about
  my whole collection using up all of my hard drive.  I can see what I
  have in a particular repository with the <code>git annex find</code> command.
</p>
<p>
  As I said, there are many other uses for git-annex and features that
  I have not yet learned.  One thing that I am interested in trying
  out is using the <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/web/">web</a> as a repository.
