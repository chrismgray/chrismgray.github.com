&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Waynesboro to Daleville&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//./posts/hiking/north-va&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned what a hard time I had in the
  Shenandoah National Park because of the rain.  In Waynesboro, I
  decided to do something about that.  I mailed my rain jacket home
  and went to an outfitters to get a new one.  I got a nice compact
  down jacket while I was at it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There is a diner in town that has all-you-can-eat pancakes, so
  breakfast and lunch were taken care of.  I couldn&#39;t walk very fast
  with so much food in my stomach, though, so I didn&#39;t go far past
  Waynesboro.  At the shelter, I met Farm-a-sea, whose trail name had
  a double meaning.  He was training to become a fish farmer when he
  wasn&#39;t hiking, and he also had a sizable cache of medicinal herbs.
  He was an interesting guy though.  He would pack a dozen eggs and a
  large hunk of bacon out of town.  He had a skillet for frying them
  in, and would build a fire at every shelter and cook his supper in
  the skillet.  Really old-school stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The terrain in Virginia became hilly once again.  After the flatness
  of Pennsylvania, this took some getting used to.  Also, since
  Southern Pennsylvania, the leaves had been falling, and by Central
  Virginia, they were falling in earnest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/---71aZGG9Pw/TOXBaqs19sI/AAAAAAAAA5A/yMiEIbVmITA/s800/DSCF0279.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/---71aZGG9Pw/TOXBaqs19sI/AAAAAAAAA5A/yMiEIbVmITA/s800/DSCF0279.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It was in this section that I realized that I had not packed enough
  food for the number of days that I would need if I was going to
  continue at the same average speed.  Thus, I needed to pick up my
  average mileage considerably.  I did two 30-mile days and two
  25-mile days into Daleville.  There was some interesting scenery on
  the way, including this rock formation, rather ominously named &quot;The
  Guillotine&quot;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5QG7ZkAwCsw/TOXBkYjN3vI/AAAAAAAAA7w/ToGxgOOKRSo/s800/DSCF0298.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5QG7ZkAwCsw/TOXBkYjN3vI/AAAAAAAAA7w/ToGxgOOKRSo/s800/DSCF0298.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  By the time I got to Daleville, I was in a pretty serious calorie
  deficit.  I went and had a big supper at a crappy Mexican
  restaurant, followed by two beers from the store in my motel room.
  I could tell midway through the second beer that it wasn&#39;t a good
  idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Daleville to Damascus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I was hung over all the next day.  However, following my experience
  from the previous week, I tried to make miles and not allow it to
  slow me down.  I didn&#39;t want to be stuck without food once again.
  Hiking with a hangover is really terrible, though, and it seemed
  like every 10 minutes I needed to sit down or bend over and try to
  vomit.  I didn&#39;t get anything out all day, but I didn&#39;t eat anything
  either, so by the end of the day I was getting hungry.  I took this
  as a good sign and ate some Teriyaki Noodles.  I couldn&#39;t keep them
  down through the night, but after I had gone into the woods to
  deposit them on the ground, I finally felt better.  However, the
  memory of that day has been enough to keep me from drinking alcohol
  ever since.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/McAfee_Knob.jpg/1024px-McAfee_Knob.jpg&quot;  alt=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4c/McAfee_Knob.jpg/1024px-McAfee_Knob.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  
  The next days were better, though marred by bad trail maintenance
  and ragweed.  One highlight was the second-largest oak tree on the
  trail:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6sYDOs4YlL4/TOXBsVEoBOI/AAAAAAAAA9w/uI7VlAy6UmY/s800/DSCF0312.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6sYDOs4YlL4/TOXBsVEoBOI/AAAAAAAAA9w/uI7VlAy6UmY/s800/DSCF0312.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The day after that picture was taken, I ended up at The Captain&#39;s
  place, a small hostel with tenting in the yard.  The really
  interesting feature of it was that you needed to take a cable car
  across the creek to get there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The following day, I ended up at Pearisburg.  It is another
  spread-out town, and I had to walk a couple of miles to get to the
  store.  However, I had had a sleeping bag sent there because mine
  had been leaking feathers for quite a while, and I was able to pick
  it up, so that was nice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I went to the Woods Hole hostel the next day, which was a greatly
  relaxing day.  One of the hostel-keepers teaches yoga and the other
  is a masseur (though the massages weren&#39;t free, and I didn&#39;t feel
  like getting one).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-as7GEIfL9gY/TOXB5mbZT9I/AAAAAAAABA0/VeqESiZRKfc/s800/DSCF0332.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-as7GEIfL9gY/TOXB5mbZT9I/AAAAAAAABA0/VeqESiZRKfc/s800/DSCF0332.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  After Woods Hole, I really started rolling.  I did a 20-mile day the
  next day and a 34-mile day the day after that.  This took me to the
  Chestnut Knob shelter, which is a completely enclosed shelter on the
  top of a mountain.  It was windy all night, but I slept fairly
  comfortably after my long day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next two days weren&#39;t too special.  I stayed in a motel near the
  interstate and a shelter that was reportedly haunted (though I saw
  no evidence of a haunting).  The day after that, though I entered
  the Grayson Highlands State Park.  This is a park that is famous for
  the wild ponies that roam it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Pi9paLjIp4w/TOXCC-zwgTI/AAAAAAAABCw/2s80vuVgMmk/s800/DSCF0345.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Pi9paLjIp4w/TOXCC-zwgTI/AAAAAAAABCw/2s80vuVgMmk/s800/DSCF0345.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I got a picture with me near them that shows how small they really
  are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-W6OOfZuUnlM/TOXCD941S_I/AAAAAAAABDE/I7ZbXLwWgY4/s800/DSCF0347.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-W6OOfZuUnlM/TOXCD941S_I/AAAAAAAABDE/I7ZbXLwWgY4/s800/DSCF0347.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I had heard that they will come up to you and lick or chew your pack
  in order to get the salt from your sweat, but that didn&#39;t happen to
  me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Just before I got to the Grayson Highlands, I met up with another
  group of hikers: Skittles, Flora, Abear, and Coyote.  I had been
  following most of them in the shelter logs for months, so it was
  like meeting old friends.  Flora in particular signed her name with
  a large flower (her hiking partner Fauna had left near Washington,
  DC), so her entries were hard to miss.  We hiked together off and on
  for a few days, and it was nice to be hiking with people once again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We all stopped together in Damascus, VA and found cheap
  accommodation in a building run by a local church.  It was empty,
  but it had strict rules (no cooking in the rooms was the one they
  seemed most concerned with) and a person came during the night to
  make sure that we were following them.  I found a new pair of shoes
  on sale in Damascus, so I got them and got rid of my previous pair
  which were falling apart.  They had only lasted about 500 miles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I left Damascus early the next day, leaving the group behind.
  Skittles would catch up with me and we would hike together a bit
  longer, but I didn&#39;t see the rest again.  Just past Damascus, I left
  Virginia for Tennessee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hwZeFpMUAJk/TOXCIxbQ-3I/AAAAAAAABEI/DC0DPcb6umI/s800/DSCF0353.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hwZeFpMUAJk/TOXCIxbQ-3I/AAAAAAAABEI/DC0DPcb6umI/s800/DSCF0353.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Next Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Tennessee and North Carolina.  A run of four straight hostels, and
  the weather finally turning cold.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;4-State Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The challenges long-distance hikers create for themselves are
  essentially stupid.  You generally don&#39;t get anything for completing
  them, and they have a tendency to make you feel bad.  For example,
  on the PCT, there is a challenge that involves hiking from a town to
  a hostel while drinking a beer every mile.  Since the distance
  between the places is 24 miles, it seems remarkably foolhardy to
  me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  With that out of the way, let me tell you about the challenge that I
  did.  It involves hiking in 4 states in under 24 hours.  I started
  in Pennsylvania, hiked most of the day in Maryland, went through
  Harpers Ferry in West Virginia, and ended the day in Virginia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I started the day just after midnight, and wished Picker and Grinner
  a silent &quot;good luck&quot;.  Even though there was a nearly-full moon, the
  night was pretty dark, and I needed my head lamp all night.  Shortly
  into Maryland, I tweaked my ankle pretty badly, and so I was slowed
  a bit for the rest of the night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  By 4 in the morning, I had not gone very far, and I decided to take
  a nap.  I found a reasonably flat rock and laid down right beside
  the trail.  I slept until about 6, by which time the sun was coming
  up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I had gone around 20 miles by lunch time, so I took it at the
  Washington Monument:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VDW_BuMm5kI/TOXBGjbmAHI/AAAAAAAAAzY/V_Ga-ezEt4Q/s800/DSCF0238.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VDW_BuMm5kI/TOXBGjbmAHI/AAAAAAAAAzY/V_Ga-ezEt4Q/s800/DSCF0238.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  This is clearly not the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_monument&quot;&gt;Washington Monument&lt;/a&gt; that is in Washington,
  DC, but it was the first one, and that should count for something.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The trail in Maryland was pretty good, and there was a lot of
  history associated with the places that I was hiking.  In some
  sense, it is a shame that I went through so quickly.  In particular,
  the last shelter in Maryland was one of the nicest that I saw.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It was about 6 or 7 by the time I left Maryland, and the sun was
  starting to set.  I entered &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Ferry&quot;&gt;Harpers Ferry&lt;/a&gt; and started to look for a
  place to get some food.  It took me a while to get my bearings, and
  by the time I found a street with bars and restaurants, they were
  all closed.  It seems that Harpers Ferry is completely a
  tourist town, and no restaurants are open after about 8:00.
  Finally, I found a restaurant with open doors and went in, despite a
  sign saying that the restaurant was closed.  I practically begged
  the waitress to get me some food, and in the end I overpaid quite a
  lot for a mediocre sandwich.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I went to the headquarters of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy,
  which was also closed, and looked around, trying to find a hose.
  Someone must have thought that I looked suspicious, because one of
  the workers eventually showed up and showed me where the hose was.
  I filled my water bottles, thanked the employee, and went on my
  way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It seems cruel, but the trail climbs a hill for about two miles from
  Harpers Ferry to the Virginia border.  I had walked 43 miles by the
  time I made it to the border, and I was completely beat.  I hung my
  hammock just past the border sign and settled into bed at about
  10:30 PM.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I awoke the next morning later than usual, and hung most of my gear
  in a tree.  I wanted to go back to Harpers Ferry, since it is
  customary for thru-hikers to visit the ATC and have their picture
  taken.  So I went back with a mostly-empty pack.  I had my picture
  taken and hung around until nearly noon.  During the time that I was
  there, some section-hikers also came in.  We talked for a while
  about the differences between the thru-hiking experience and the
  section-hiking experience, and they gave me some of their
  freeze-dried meals, which were of a much higher quality than the
  meals I generally ate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Harpers Ferry to Waynesboro, VA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually, I left the ATC.  I climbed the hill again, got the rest
  of my gear, and hiked about 7 miles further down the trail.  The
  next day I did 10 miles by lunch time and called it a day at a
  really nice hostel: the Bear&#39;s Den.  If you are ever in the
  Washington, DC area and would like a hostel experience, this is the
  place for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I lounged and let my legs recuperate.  The Bear&#39;s Den has a nice
  deal where you can stay at the hostel, get a frozen pizza and a pint
  of Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s ice cream for pretty cheap.  Even though I had
  recently completed the half-gallon challenge, I was certainly ready
  for some Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  After the Bear&#39;s Den, there is a section of trail called &quot;The
  Roller Coaster&quot;.  This is primarily meant to scare northbounders who
  haven&#39;t seen any real mountains yet.  The terrain is a bit bumpy,
  but there was really nothing to worry about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The following day I stopped in at Front Royal, VA for a resupply.  I
  had to wait a very long time for a hitch (the famed Southern
  hospitality had apparently not yet kicked in).  I noticed that my
  pocket knife was missing, so I called the Bear&#39;s Den, and they had
  found it.  They very generously sent it on to me at a town that was
  down the trail.  I left Front Royal, and camped just a couple of
  miles before boundary of Shenandoah National Park.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  My experience in &quot;The Shennies&quot; was not great.  It rained nearly the
  whole time that I was there, and there is a road that the trail
  crosses something like 20 times in the park.  By the last day, I had
  determined that the rain jacket that I had was not really
  waterproof, and when it got really wet it just made me colder.  I
  had rain pants, but they were not breathable at all, so my legs
  would get nearly as wet from sweat as they would from rain.  On the
  last day, I procrastinated in the shelter as long as I could (I
  finished the book I was reading), and then went back out into the
  rain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I walked 20 miles that day without stopping on trails that were more
  like creeks.  I left Shenandoah and was very glad to do so.  Just
  past the boundary is another road, and I somewhat forced myself on a
  motorist to take me into Waynesboro, VA.  When I got to Waynesboro,
  the sun was coming out, and I was able to camp in town rather than
  paying for a hotel.  I took a shower at the YMCA, had a meal in a
  restaurant, and finally felt better.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Central Virginia.  If I&#39;m feeling ambitious, also Southern
  Virginia.  Once I get there, the trail&#39;s almost done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my last entry, Pennsylvania is many hikers&#39;
least-favorite state on the trail.  This comes down to one thing:
rocks.  All the states have some rocks, but in Pennsylvania, they are
relentless.  They tend to be small, firmly stuck into the earth, and
just the right shape for turning your ankle or at least moving your
foot in your shoe.  Since we were regularly doing 20-mile days by this
point in the trail, we saw a lot of rocks every day.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Delaware Water Gap to Palmerton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Delaware Water Gap is named because it is a gap in the ridge caused
  by the Delaware River.  It has a quaint little town, and we stopped
  in to get some pie and do a little shopping (I needed to replace my
  water bag, which had sprung a leak in New York).  We didn&#39;t stay in
  town for the night, though, and went to a shelter with a nice view
  from the ridge.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day, we walked along the flat ridge all the way to the next
  gap, called Wind Gap, where we hitched into town for the night.
  Watching CNN, we learned that there were forest fires in Colorado,
  right near where Just Jill lived.  Since only about 90 houses were
  burned down, I thought the probability of her being affected was
  pretty small, but I hoped that she wasn&#39;t nonetheless.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Wind Gap was one of the least hiker-friendly towns that we stayed
  in.  As a hiker, you pretty much have to walk everywhere, so it is
  good if the town is very small and compact.  Wind Gap was not
  compact, and it also had no sidewalks.  When we went to get
  groceries, we had to cross a very large road, and people were
  honking their horns at us as if the lack of proper signals in the
  town was our fault.  All in all, it wasn&#39;t a great town, and I
  wouldn&#39;t recommend that other hikers stay there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We climbed up from the gap the next day and found Just Jill in a
  clearing at the top, putting away her tent.  Her house had indeed
  burned down in the fires.  Unfortunately, that meant the end of the
  trail for her.  Most importantly, her boyfriend and dog were okay,
  and she was flying out to Colorado to meet them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There was really nothing that we could do, so we kept on walking.
  Near the end of the day, we came to one of the most environmentally
  degraded areas of the trail: the Palmerton &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfund&quot;&gt;Superfund&lt;/a&gt; site.  After
  months of mostly walking in forests, this was a completely bare
  ridge devoid of all trees.  The lack of trees was apparently a
  result of the zinc-smelting industry in the town poisoning the soil
  with its emissions.  It didn&#39;t bother me too much, but Picker
  especially thought it was creepy, and so we hustled through the
  deforested area.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  However, before we could make it completely past the deforestation,
  we needed to descend into Lehigh Gap.  This was one of the hardest
  descents we had since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//./posts/hiking/new-hampshire-1&quot;&gt;White Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.  I was glad to get to the
  bottom of the descent, but it just meant that we had to up to the
  next ridge.  We saw two snakes at the shelter that we stayed at that
  night &amp;ndash; mice are attracted by the crumbs hikers leave behind and
  snakes are attracted by the mice &amp;ndash; so it was a bit hard to get to
  sleep, and I checked my shoes pretty carefully when I got out of my
  hammock the next night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Palmerton to Duncannon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The hiking in this section was honestly not that interesting.  The
  ridges were flat and rocky, and we simply tried to pass the time and
  make miles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  After Wind Gap, we stayed in Port Clinton, where we went to the
  world&#39;s largest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cabelas.com/&quot;&gt;Cabela&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;.  They actually picked us up and drove us
  to the store.  It is supposed to be an outdoors store, but it is
  more of a hunting and fishing store, so we didn&#39;t find too much to
  interest us.  However, they did have an all-you-can-eat buffet, so
  we gorged ourselves a bit.  The next day was the first day of the
  NCAA football season, and Picker was a die-hard University of Miami
  fan, so we needed to get to town and find a hotel with ESPN.  The
  only town that we thought we could get to was Shartlesville, which
  is marked in the guide book, but which is only accessible from the
  trail via a dirt road.  Since there was no possibility of a hitch
  (and the football game was so crucial to see), we walked the nearly
  4 miles to town.  It turned out to be little more than a rest-stop
  on the interstate, but we found a hotel with cable and checked in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Miami lost, and the next day it was lightly raining.  So we decided
  to take a zero (my first since Vermont) and stay in the hotel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We walked back to the trail the next day (walking off-trail is never
  fun for me) and continued on.  I really don&#39;t remember much of the
  next few days.  I can guarantee you that there were rocks.
  Eventually, we crossed the Susquehanna River and walked into
  Duncannon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Duncannon is one of the most popular towns on the trail.  It has a
  cheap hole-in-the-wall hotel with decent food and good beer where
  all hikers stay.  I met up with my uncle there and we had a very
  nice supper.  The next day was drizzling again, and again we decided
  that we would rather not walk in the rain, so we took another zero.
  Since my uncle had paid for our rooms the previous night
  (unbeknownst to me), we felt that we would not be breaking the bank
  by doing this.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  However, the next day, we felt that we had some miles to make up.
  We had planned to make it to Boiling Springs in two days from
  Duncannon, but we did it in one day instead.  Grinner wasn&#39;t too
  happy about going 26 miles, but the terrain was pretty flat and we
  crossed a road every mile or two, so it was pretty easy to keep
  track of how far we needed to go.  Plus, we had mostly gotten rid of
  the rocks that had been plaguing us, so we could walk a bit faster.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Midpoint to Border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Late the next day, we hit Pine Grove Furnace State Park.  It&#39;s a
  really nice State Park, but it has the feature of having the nearest
  convenience store to the midpoint of the trail.  There&#39;s a tradition
  known as the Half-Gallon Challenge that occurs there.  Since you&#39;ve
  come halfway, you must eat a half-gallon of ice cream in under an
  hour.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6YpYvoAaNIg/TOXBEOMWPII/AAAAAAAAAy0/EvknY6GNZBY/s800/DSCF0231.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-6YpYvoAaNIg/TOXBEOMWPII/AAAAAAAAAy0/EvknY6GNZBY/s800/DSCF0231.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As you can see, I left a little bit in my beard, but I finished it
  with plenty of time to spare.  Picker finished his half-gallon a bit
  faster than me, but Grinner didn&#39;t quite make it &amp;ndash; she left about
  three bites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  None of us felt wonderful after consuming that much ice cream, so we
  didn&#39;t go much farther that night.  The next morning, however, we
  hit the midpoint of the trail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GVEBEnvJk30/TOXBEuKmZUI/AAAAAAAAAy8/v4wWFXvj6mU/s800/DSCF0232.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GVEBEnvJk30/TOXBEuKmZUI/AAAAAAAAAy8/v4wWFXvj6mU/s800/DSCF0232.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Around this time, the oak trees were shedding their acorns, so as we
  walked, we would hear the acorns hitting the ground.  Occasionally
  someone would get hit by one.  They were pretty big acorns, so they
  would hurt and leave a bruise.  At our campsite for that night,
  there was a large group of birds in the trees above us.  They shook
  the branches even more than usual, so we had a veritable hailstorm
  of acorns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We went into Waynesboro, PA the next day and I bought new shoes (my
  previous pair lasting nearly 800 miles).  We also had a Chinese
  buffet.  Somewhere in the previous few days I had lost my trowel, so
  I went to a garden store and got a new one.  (I never used a trowel
  all that much because I usually stayed near a shelter and most
  shelters have privies, but it is important to have one for
  emergencies.)  We resupplied in town and walked on for a couple of
  miles to a campsite just before the border.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I had a plan for a crazy amount of miles the next day, so it was to
  be my last day with Picker and Grinner.  We had walked with each
  other for nearly 1000 miles, so I was sorry to leave them.  I took a
  picture of our campsite, with them doing a fairly typical activity:
  playing rummy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vshGTrWxiFw/TOXBFTwUYII/AAAAAAAAAzE/L_Ia2O_1GAA/s800/DSCF0235.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vshGTrWxiFw/TOXBFTwUYII/AAAAAAAAAzE/L_Ia2O_1GAA/s800/DSCF0235.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-4&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The day with the crazy mileage, taking me into Virginia.  Since
  Virginia is the longest state on the trail (nearly a third of the
  miles), I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t be able to write the whole thing in one
  entry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey, or Joisey as the TV would have you say it, isn&#39;t really a
place that you think of when you think about hiking.  The stereotype
is one of chemical factories and Guidos on the Jersey Shore.  However,
it&#39;s called the Garden State for a reason.  There is a lot of beauty
in New Jersey, and I found it far away from the beach.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On our first full day in New Jersey, we hiked 17 miles by lunch time.
It was a town day, so our packs were light and we were looking forward
to sleeping in a hostel.  The trail was also incredibly easy, with a
one-mile stretch of boardwalk at one point.  The last two miles were
also on a former railroad bed.  Since trains can only go up the most
gentle of hills, it is always nice to walk where they once were.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I was saying, we reached town by lunch time.  We had to go back
into New York to get to town, but it was worth it.  There was a small
pizzeria with great food (for once I could only eat half of a pizza),
and we made our way to the &quot;Mayor&#39;s House&quot; (aka the &quot;Outhouse&quot;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Mayor (who wasn&#39;t really the mayor, but who had run at one point)
was a charming older guy with the gift of gab.  This is a guy who can
really talk.  One interesting feature of the house is that he had
requested that people mail him stones from every state of the trail,
and he had made a walkway from them in the back yard.  Since the trail
is government property for the most part, this had received the
attention of the authorities, who had sent the chief ranger to inspect
it.  One strange thing about this particular hostel is that one
requirement of hikers is that they must watch a motivational video in
order to stay there.  There was some eye-rolling about this at first,
but it was not a bad video.  It was about a Susan-Boyle-type singer on
the X Factor TV show, who had overcome looking plain to sing opera
well.  The message that the Mayor was trying to impart with the video
was encapsulated by the line that the singer sang: &quot;Vincero, Vincero,
Vincero&quot;, from Turandot.  (I will win, I will make it, I will finish
this hike.)  It sounds cheesy, but the story was nice, and it gave you
something to think about if you got down during the hike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a great breakfast, we headed out again.  We didn&#39;t go far, and
stopped at a shelter.  Every shelter in New Jersey has a bear box,
which is essentially a locker with a complicated handle that bears
can&#39;t figure out to store food in.  This is much more convenient than
hanging food from a tree branch, and it keeps the bears (which are all
over New Jersey) from getting too comfortable around shelters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day, we passed by the highest point in New Jersey, which has
its own monument:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s8awWxSKIOU/TOXA4yklbTI/AAAAAAAAAw0/nnwa6hiwlcw/s800/DSCF0219.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-s8awWxSKIOU/TOXA4yklbTI/AAAAAAAAAw0/nnwa6hiwlcw/s800/DSCF0219.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Going down the hill from the high point, we saw our first bears of the
trip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-X5MOSZiWs50/TOXA5hBqqLI/AAAAAAAAAw8/SUmfDKEbx-0/s800/DSCF0220.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-X5MOSZiWs50/TOXA5hBqqLI/AAAAAAAAAw8/SUmfDKEbx-0/s800/DSCF0220.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was a mother and her cub, but we were only close enough to get a
picture of the cub.  It seemed at first as if the cub was going to
climb a tree to get away from us, which would have been the worst
possible thing to happen.  In that case, the mother would have
defended the tree and we would have had to go far out of our way to
avoid them.  We were lucky, though, and the cub just kept going, as
did we.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day was less exciting, but we saw another bear the day after
that.  We were walking on a dirt road, and it was right ahead of us.
Grinner was so excited to see the bear that she started skipping down
the road.  Try skipping with twenty or thirty pounds of stuff in a
backpack, and you&#39;ll see that she must have been &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; excited.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We spent the night at the Mohican Outdoor Center.  We had to pay a
little bit to camp, but they had bear boxes, and considering the
amount of bears in the area, we thought they would be worth it.  It
turned out that it was good that the bear boxes were there, because a
bear apparently came into the camp and tried to get at food.  I&#39;m a
sound sleeper, which is why I can only say &quot;apparently&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day would be our last in the state.  We walked up onto a
ridge, from where I was able to take some nice sunrise pictures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3L8Q43a9C5o/TOXBBe0VxgI/AAAAAAAAAyQ/GSOewt5CxhM/s800/DSCF0228.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3L8Q43a9C5o/TOXBBe0VxgI/AAAAAAAAAyQ/GSOewt5CxhM/s800/DSCF0228.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After that, we went past the southernmost glacial lake on the trail,
named Sunfish Pond.  Finally, we began our descent into &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_Water_Gap&quot;&gt;Delaware Water Gap&lt;/a&gt;, which marks the border between New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Next Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Pennsylvania.  It&#39;s many hikers&#39; least-favorite state, but I had a
  nice time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>
&lt;p&gt;Spurred on by the first comment by an actual user of my plugin today,
I tracked down one of the major bottlenecks for external ikiwiki
plugins.  My fix might not be the most elegant, but it works so far.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Ikiwiki plugins work by calling a function named &lt;code&gt;hook&lt;/code&gt; which lets
  them tell the ikiwiki compiler that they implement a certain
  subroutine.  Whenever that subroutine needs to be called, the
  ikiwiki compiler calls &lt;code&gt;run_hooks&lt;/code&gt;, and that runs all the registered
  functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For most of these hooked functions (&lt;code&gt;htmlize&lt;/code&gt; is the only exception
  I can think of), all of the registered functions are called,
  regardless of file type.  This is normally not a problem, because
  the plugin can check the type of content that it is given and only
  operate on the types of content that it knows anything about.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  For external plugins, however, there is a problem.  Ikiwiki
  communicates with external plugins via xml-rpc on &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; and
  &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;.  Every function call that it makes involves writing the
  function&#39;s parameters on &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;.  When there is a file type that
  is unknown to the external plugin, all that effort (I/O is the main
  time sink I think, but the content must also be encoded correctly
  for xml-rpc) is wasted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I have added a parameter named &quot;exclusive&quot; to the optional arguments
  that are accepted by the &lt;code&gt;hook&lt;/code&gt; function.  When this argument exists
  (and is true), the registered function is only run when the type of
  file is the same as the type of file that the plugin accepts.  So
  far, it only works with the &lt;code&gt;scan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;linkify&lt;/code&gt; hooks, which were
  the main areas that slowed my plugin down.  However, it is quite
  simple to get it to work with other hooks as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>
&lt;p&gt;New York State has the reputation of being one long jaunt from deli to
concession stand to food truck, but it seemed that by the time we were
there, they had all left.  What I remember most about hiking in New
York is that we were never very far from a road, and there are plenty
of motorcycles to remind you of the fact.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first two days in New York were largely flat and unmemorable.  We
did have one small problem when we wanted to get a resupply on our
second day.  Hitchhiking is illegal in New York, so we eventually had
to call a taxi to take us into a little town.  To leave town, we were
thinking about doing the same thing, until I noticed a pizza-delivery
car in the parking lot of the shopping centre that we were in.  I went
to the pizza place and ordered a delivery.  I would only buy the pizza
if they delivered it (and us) to the trail.  It was a double-score: a
great lunch, and a free ride back to the trail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the third day, we crossed the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson
River.  At that point, the Hudson is nearly at sea level, so we were
nearly to the lowest point on the trail.  The bridge is a few hundred
feet above the river and has many signs urging people not to jump.
Naturally, these signs make me think of jumping, so I scooted across
the bridge as quickly as I could.  It&#39;s a bit strange to be a hiker
that&#39;s afraid of heights, but it&#39;s an issue that really doesn&#39;t come
up too much.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After the bridge, we entered a zoo.  It&#39;s not a great zoo, but the
trail goes through it, so in we went.  I&#39;m not a big fan of zoos
anyway, and when the lowest point on the trail was right next to the
bear enclosure, it seemed apt.  Past the zoo, we entered &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Mountain_State_Park&quot;&gt;Bear Mountain State Park&lt;/a&gt;.  It was awful too.  Full of people, nearly all paved over,
with rangers in golf carts.  We stopped at a concession stand and got
an overpriced soda.  The trail up the mountain had fewer people, but
just as much trash.  We even saw a pair of men&#39;s underwear right next
to the trail.  The higher we went, however, the more sparse the trash
became, and when we reached the summit, the trail had become mostly
clean once again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the other side of the summit, we saw a couple of deer.  They
skittered away, but then we saw them five minutes later.  And five
minutes after that.  They were clearly habituated to humans, and
seemed to be playing coy with us.  We hiked over one more small
mountain but by the time we were going up Black Mountain, both Picker
and I were having heat-related chafing issues.  We stopped at the top
of Black Mountain and took some pictures of the sun reflecting off the
New York City skyline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tmsoXjXxiv0/TOXA0yMh11I/AAAAAAAAAvs/HlPqqSVUyCk/s800/DSCF0210.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tmsoXjXxiv0/TOXA0yMh11I/AAAAAAAAAvs/HlPqqSVUyCk/s800/DSCF0210.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sunset was pretty too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-etjpnUs9h58/TOXA1-vH4sI/AAAAAAAAAv0/CNg06w_N8IU/s800/DSCF0211.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-etjpnUs9h58/TOXA1-vH4sI/AAAAAAAAAv0/CNg06w_N8IU/s800/DSCF0211.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day was hot as well.  We went down to a lake with showers and
vending machines, but everything was locked up.  Nearing the end of
the day, we hit a water cache that had a note inside from the people
who had left it.  The note said to give them a call and they would
come and pick us up.  It turned out that they were busy when we
called, but we didn&#39;t have much to do, so we just hung out and waited
for them.  When they did come and pick us up, they were so nice.  They
practically forced us to eat with them and we slept in extremely
comfortable beds after a luxurious shower.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In some sense, we had been lucky to get to the cache when we did,
because Just Jill and Day Tripper were right behind us and would have
taken the hospitality if we didn&#39;t beat them to it.  I&#39;ve introduced
Just Jill before, but Day Tripper is new.  My main memory of her is of
her mobile phone.  It was always on and she was always doing something
with it.  She was a bit behind a larger group of people and was
keeping in close contact with them.  The morning after our stay with
the people who had left the cache, we thought that she and Just Jill
must be ahead of us, because they would not need a ride to get to the
trail.  However, we soon heard Day Tripper talking on her phone as
she was walking up the mountain, right behind us.  It was a bit
strange for me, but she was a nice person, so I tried to not let it
get in the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, the rest of the day was pretty flat, so the five us could
walk at a good pace and chat a bit.  We hit a hot-dog stand at lunch
time (not so great for a vegetarian: when I asked if he had veggie
dogs, he laughed at me), and before long, we crossed into New Jersey.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-k02LG0nkYp0/TOXA4n6sBGI/AAAAAAAAAws/pzQ5UqRdUYw/s800/DSCF0218.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-k02LG0nkYp0/TOXA4n6sBGI/AAAAAAAAAws/pzQ5UqRdUYw/s800/DSCF0218.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Next Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  It might sound like we were going out of the frying pan and into the
  fire, but the trail in New Jersey is actually really beautiful.  It
  also has the highest concentration of bears of any state on the
  trail.  Foreshadowing!
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Connecticut begins with a steep uphill, but when you get to the top
  of that, you are at the highest point of the state.  I always like
  hitting the high-point of a state because it tells me that the net
  effort that I must expend in the remainder of that state is less
  than the effort that I&#39;ve already expended.  For my computer-science
  readers, there&#39;s also a nice little problem there: how do you
  compute the set of points on the trail for which there are no higher
  points remaining in the state?  (It turns out that you can do it
  with a simple extension of a problem that I had worked on before,
  but I won&#39;t say more than that to let you have the fun of solving it
  yourself.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We walked down the mountain and stopped in a the town of Salisbury,
  CT for lunch and a small resupply.  As we were walking into town,
  a northbound hiker was walking out, and he let us pick through the
  extra stuff that he had received in the mail.  I took some Jolly
  Ranchers, but they were really sticky.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We walked on and arrived at Limestone Spring Lean-to, which is
  pretty far off the trail on a steep downhill.  It&#39;s quite
  frustrating when this happens, because that means that you have a
  long uphill first thing in the morning.  So Picker and I went down
  to the spring to gather water.  We hiked a mile or so farther that
  evening and set up a stealth camp.  As the picture ending the
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//./posts/hiking/massachusetts&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; indicates, this is not strictly legal.  We made sure to be
  quite a ways from the trail, but we worried about rangers all
  evening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day was a bit of a long one.  We decided not to camp
  illegally again, so we had two choices for camp sites &amp;ndash; one about
  13 miles away and one about 23 miles away.  Naturally, we chose to
  head for the farther campsite.  When we got within 3 miles, I
  decided that I didn&#39;t want to walk for more than another hour, so I
  really pushed hard to get to camp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day had some nice scenery:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cEvLxZBiQEM/TOXAywwRf9I/AAAAAAAAAvM/SHS1g8Ih370/s800/DSCF0203.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cEvLxZBiQEM/TOXAywwRf9I/AAAAAAAAAvM/SHS1g8Ih370/s800/DSCF0203.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  after we went over a small mountain, we got to Kent, CT.  We were
  rather early to town, so we got breakfast at one of the posh
  restaurants.  I had a waffle with ice cream.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As we were walking away from Kent, we met a couple walking their
  dog.  In the course of conversation, they mentioned that they had
  sent their daughter to the prep school that we walked past between
  the trail and town.  Without batting an eye, one of them said that
  the yearly tuition was $20000!  The school had a beautiful campus,
  so we could now know where the funds for that came from, but it
  seemed excessive to me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We crossed the border with New York, but we were soon back in
  Connecticut.  We stopped at a campsite just past a bridge and met up
  with Just Jill once again.  I slept with the tarp off of my hammock,
  which turned out to be a mistake as the weather in the small valley
  where we camped was extremely cold overnight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning, we would leave Connecticut for good and enter New
  York.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  New York.  Poorly-maintained trails near big roads.  The lowest
  point on the whole AT right next to caged bears (it couldn&#39;t get
  much more symbolic than that).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts is the first of two short states along the trail that
will give me fits when I try to type them.  From now on, I will call
it MA.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Border to Great Barrington&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Just across the border with Vermont, there is a road with two small
  towns on either side of the intersection with the trail.
  Williamstown had the larger store, so that is the one we went to.
  We got a small resupply at the store and a couple of cold sodas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We went on, with the goal of getting to the top of Mt. Greylock by
  lunch time.  For some reason, I had thought that Mt. Greylock would
  have a gondola at the top and we could take a ride as we ate our
  lunch.  Unfortunately, this turned out not to be the case (though I
  think people do use it as a ski hill, so I was not so far off), and
  it had a couple of interesting structures on top instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WAWPz3bbVek/TOXAwZ1kqAI/AAAAAAAAAuw/XATrStfxuSA/s800/DSCF0196.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WAWPz3bbVek/TOXAwZ1kqAI/AAAAAAAAAuw/XATrStfxuSA/s800/DSCF0196.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The picture above is a war memorial, and there was also an old lodge
  that had some light refreshments as well.  Since we had just been to
  the store, we didn&#39;t need the services of the lodge, so we sat
  outside and dried our shelters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  When we got to the bottom of the mountain, it was getting late, and
  we got to a town, so we decided to stay there.  We heard that a
  local church would let hikers sleep inside, so we did that.  The
  church did not have any shower facilities, and this led to a rather
  embarrassing situation at dinner.  We went to a pub with some
  trail-related items on the menu, and after we sat down, the
  bartender came over and closed the window &amp;ndash; saying that she had had
  complaints about the way we smelled!  To be fair, it had been quite
  a while since we had showers, but there must have been a better way
  of handling the situation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day, we hiked to the town of Dalton, where we got showers
  at the YMCA and hung out for a while.  Dalton has a hostel or two,
  but since we had gotten there so early, we decided to go to the
  shelter a few miles out of town anyway.  Since we were walking such
  a short distance from town, we packed out subs and enjoyed some
  fresh vegetables at dinner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day was almost completely flat, and I don&#39;t really remember
  anything beyond the fact that it rained a bit.  At the end of the
  day, however, we reached Upper Goose Pond Cabin.  This is a quaint
  cabin on a lake, with a caretaker and bunks upstairs.  Effectively,
  it is a cross between a hostel and a really good trail shelter.
  There was a mix of northbounders and southbounders that were staying
  there for the night, but they had plenty of room.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning began with pancakes, and then we set off again.  We
  came across a large group of university students on an orientation
  hike.  I think this particular group was from Yale, but we met
  groups from other Ivy League schools as well over the next week or
  so.  The really funny thing about these groups is that they would go
  about 5 miles per day.  Considering that we were going 10 miles
  before lunch, we were in a constant state of bafflement over how
  they could go so slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  At the end of the day, we got to a road and went into the town of
  Great Barrington (the birthplace of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois&quot;&gt;W. E. B. Du Bois&lt;/a&gt;).  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Great Barrington to the border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Leaving Great Barrington posed a rather thorny ethical question.
  There are two roads leaving town, and we had come in on the first
  (northernmost) one.  Should we leave town on that road or on the
  second one, saving 8 miles of walking?  Some hikers would have taken
  the second, but we all considered it cheating, so we took the
  first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We got a ride just as we had taken out a camera to get a picture of
  ourselves hitchhiking, which we took as a sign.  I think we tried to
  repeat that a few times, but it never worked quite as well again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Our destination for the night was a pair shelters that between them
  had space for 16 people.  We figured that this would be more than
  enough space, but we were wrong.  More groups of Ivy Leaguers were
  on the trail, and a few had converged on the spot.  We found some
  flattish ground nearby (another advantage of a hammock is that the
  ground doesn&#39;t need to be very flat at all) and set up for the
  night.  The university kids were not too loud, but they did have
  trouble setting up their bear bag, and finally gave up at two in the
  morning with the bag suspended only a few feet off the ground.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We were out of camp the next morning before the university kids
  awoke (one way that they could move so slowly I guess), and headed
  over a small mountain to the Connecticut border.  The border was in
  a beautiful little ravine with a brook next to it, but I only got a
  picture of the sign welcoming us to the next state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hG9-JG_66Jk/TOXAyHN76PI/AAAAAAAAAvE/FjsveRuFyJY/s800/DSCF0202.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hG9-JG_66Jk/TOXAyHN76PI/AAAAAAAAAvE/FjsveRuFyJY/s800/DSCF0202.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Connecticut.  Some crazies hike the whole thing in one day, but we
  took three.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Hanover to Rutland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  After an enjoyable two days in Hanover, it was time to hit the road
  again.  Unfortunately, the first few miles of the trail in Vermont
  are actually on road.  Road walks are bad for a hiker for a few
  reasons.  For one thing, you are taken out of the wilderness
  experience whenever you see the road.  For another, the hard surface
  tends to hurt your feet far more quickly than trail.  While there
  were times during the hike that I was glad to be walking on road
  (mainly after hiking the rocky trails of Pennsylvania), a good trail
  is almost always preferable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Rain started around lunch time, and by the time I arrived at the
  shelter, it was a downpour.  I was still not comfortable sleeping in
  shelters at this point of the hike, so I set up my hammock anyway.
  However, I went to the shelter to cook supper and found that
  sleeping there would not have been an option anyway.  It was full of
  northbounders &amp;ndash; roughly the end of the wave of northbounders that
  happens every year on the trail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The rain brought out some red efts from their hiding places.  These
  are juvenile newts that look somewhat like plastic toys.  I was
  never able to get a great photo of them, but this is one of the
  better ones:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6OUn7JW_nvg/TOXAji1HJ3I/AAAAAAAAAro/kQFlcuIKLdo/s800/DSCF0156.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6OUn7JW_nvg/TOXAji1HJ3I/AAAAAAAAAro/kQFlcuIKLdo/s800/DSCF0156.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The weather was better the next day, and I made good time.  During
  the day, I met up with Just Jill, who had been staying at the same
  shelter as me.  (Just X is a common trail name for people named X
  who can&#39;t decide on a trail name.)  She had started the trail much
  earlier than me, but had family near Hanover and was just getting
  back on the trail.  We chatted a bit about people that I only knew
  from reading log books at shelters and then went on.  Late in the
  day, I got some pretty bad chafing from the previous day&#39;s moisture
  and had to knock off before I got to my intended destination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The following day was only notable because it marked the junction of
  the AT with the Long Trail, the oldest long-distance hiking trail in
  the US.  I caught up with Just Jill again at the end of the day, at
  a shelter near the top of Mount Killington.  We agreed that we would
  get up early the next day to go to the top and take pictures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I did get up early the next morning, but didn&#39;t wake Just Jill.
  However, I did get some very nice pictures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jGaLyra_81k/TOXAkAmvm5I/AAAAAAAAArw/BfmkXk7lStw/s800/DSCF0157.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jGaLyra_81k/TOXAkAmvm5I/AAAAAAAAArw/BfmkXk7lStw/s800/DSCF0157.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZPfRLM6pUFI/TOXAk8yLnLI/AAAAAAAAAsI/KPbC3EpHhRk/s800/DSCF0159.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZPfRLM6pUFI/TOXAk8yLnLI/AAAAAAAAAsI/KPbC3EpHhRk/s800/DSCF0159.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X17lFoOGdco/TOXAmAaKhOI/AAAAAAAAAsc/rj7vIirb0CQ/s800/DSCF0161.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X17lFoOGdco/TOXAmAaKhOI/AAAAAAAAAsc/rj7vIirb0CQ/s800/DSCF0161.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HzKRZl8eawk/TOXAnuCWEvI/AAAAAAAAAsk/C1dk_d9CMKY/s800/DSCF0162.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HzKRZl8eawk/TOXAnuCWEvI/AAAAAAAAAsk/C1dk_d9CMKY/s800/DSCF0162.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  From there, the day was all downhill (literally, not
  metaphorically).  I crossed 500 miles and saw an owl.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-snHnV4Ge7vs/TOXAtm7sfuI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/xK14j7xlUHI/s640/DSCF0178.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-snHnV4Ge7vs/TOXAtm7sfuI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/xK14j7xlUHI/s640/DSCF0178.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  That night, I got to a road and decided to go to Rutland, VT.  My
  sister was playing in a musical competition that weekend, and I was
  able to take the train up to Montreal to see her.  But not before I
  stayed at a hostel run by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twelvetribes.com/&quot;&gt;Twelve Tribes&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; a sort of religious
  commune that some characterize as a cult, but who were very nice to
  me.  And they had great food and smoothies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Rutland to the Massachusetts border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  After the trip to Montreal, I was back to Rutland to start where I
  left off.  Since I got back to the trail late in the evening, I only
  walked to the first shelter a couple of miles down the trail.  I saw
  in the log book that Picker and Grinner had been there the day
  before, meaning that they were now ahead of me (I had been ahead of
  them since we split up at the beginning of the Whites).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was so excited at the prospect of catching back up with Picker and
  Grinner that I woke up at about 3:30 the next morning and, since I
  couldn&#39;t get back to sleep, I packed up and started walking.  I was
  undeterred by darkness, hills, rain, lightning, and trail re-routes
  and just kept walking all day.  Later in the day, after I had walked
  at least 20 miles, I started hearing about &quot;the best hostel on the
  trail&quot;.  I decided to make that my destination, even though it was
  another 10 miles or so.  I borrowed a mobile phone and called ahead
  to reserve a bunk.  I asked whether Picker and Grinner were there,
  and was given even more motivation to keep going when I found out
  that they were.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The last few miles of the day were down a ski run, and when I got to
  the bottom I was just about as tired as I&#39;d ever been.  However, I
  did my shopping and waited to get picked up by the guy who runs the
  hostel.  When I got to the hostel, it was as nice as it had been
  hyped to be.  It was clean and had trail memorabilia decorating the
  whole place.  On top of that, you get a pint of Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s ice
  cream as part of the low fee for staying there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Besides Picker and Grinner, there were two other couples staying at
  the hostel &amp;ndash; Lucky and Charm as well as Sherpa and Boss Lady. One
  fun way we passed the time that evening was to have everyone weigh
  their packs.  As you might expect, Sherpa&#39;s pack weight more than
  Boss Lady&#39;s, but Charm was a bit miffed to find out that her pack
  weighed at least 10 pounds more than Lucky&#39;s.  Plus, she was
  carrying a big camera, as she was (is?) an aspiring photographer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day, I was rather sore, but after the effort that I had put
  in to catch Picker and Grinner, I was not going to sit around and
  let them get ahead of me again.  Thankfully, they didn&#39;t want to go
  too far either, so we found a nice river about ten miles down the
  trail and set up an early camp.  I hung up a bear bag comically low
  to the ground, and people took pictures standing next to it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I don&#39;t remember much from the next day, but the day after that we
  went to Bennington, VT to resupply.  It was there where we had our
  easiest hitch &amp;ndash; before we even stuck our thumbs out, an old gent
  pulled over and offered us a ride back to the trail.  He was an
  entertaining guy &amp;ndash; a veteran from the Korean War who was going
  skydiving for his eightieth birthday the following week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We slept near a shelter that night where there was a gaggle of
  northbounders, some of whom were roasting marshmallows over a camp
  fire (neither of which is a common occurrence for me &amp;ndash; I&#39;m usually
  too tired to have a camp fire at the end of the day, and
  marshmallows just waste space in the pack, but they sure were tasty
  that night), and I joined them for a little while.  One of them had
  a violin and was trying to learn to play as she was on her hike, so
  I borrowed it and played a little.  All in all, it was a great day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  That night, it rained, and a dead branch fell near Picker and
  Grinner&#39;s tent &amp;ndash; a good reminder that Mother Nature doesn&#39;t care if
  you just had a great day; she&#39;ll still try to mess it up for you.
  Luckily, though, no one was hurt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning, we made it to the border and completed our third
  state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XLsTa1Hkwh0/TOXAvzWt-gI/AAAAAAAAAuk/4_CndnzBvV8/s800/DSCF0195.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XLsTa1Hkwh0/TOXAvzWt-gI/AAAAAAAAAuk/4_CndnzBvV8/s800/DSCF0195.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Massachusetts, flat and short.  Also large parties of college kids
  on orientation.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been working on a larger project lately, but in doing so I found
two little things that were independent of the project and useful
enough for me to release as Clojure packages.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Parallel Thrush&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I discussed the Clojure &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//./posts/luhnybin&quot;&gt;thrush operator&lt;/a&gt; once before.  The way that I
  have been using it lately is to operate on a stream of data, perhaps
  condensing the stream at the end into one value.  This suggested to
  me that I should be able to operate on the stream of data in
  parallel, since all of the functions that I am using are pure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  What I have done with the new package is to create a new macro
  called &lt;code&gt;||-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  This operates just like the &lt;code&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; macro already in
  Clojure, except that it splits the data in the stream and runs it in
  parallel.  Behind the scenes, it uses the Clojure &lt;code&gt;pmap&lt;/code&gt; function,
  which advises that it should only be used when the operation being
  done is CPU-intensive enough to exceed the coordination cost.  Since
  multiple functions are put together by my macro before they are
  passed to &lt;code&gt;pmap&lt;/code&gt;, following this advice should become easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As an example:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(||-&amp;gt;&amp;gt; data
       (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; big-function)
       (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; odd?)
       &lt;span style=&quot;color: #dca3a3; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;:merge&lt;/span&gt;
       (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt; +))
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  is the same as
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8cd0d3;&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; data
     (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; big-function)
     (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt; odd?)
     (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt; +))
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  but everything before the &lt;code&gt;:merge&lt;/code&gt; statement is executed in
  parallel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Of course, the source is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismgray/parallel-thrush&quot;&gt;my github&lt;/a&gt;.  The jar can also be easily
  downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojars.org/parallel-thrush&quot;&gt;clojars&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;LRU maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The project I&#39;ve been working on has partly been a struggle to
  manage resources.  Thus, I&#39;ve needed a good way to keep some of the
  resources in memory and get rid of the ones that are no longer
  relevant.  Using a &lt;code&gt;hash-map&lt;/code&gt; data structure is always nice, so I&#39;ve
  implemented a variant of a &lt;code&gt;hash-map&lt;/code&gt; that has an upper limit on its
  size.  When you try to add an element that would cause the map to
  have too many elements, it kicks out the element that was least
  recently added or modified.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt; lru-map 4 (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt; 20))
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #708070;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #7f9f7f;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; {12 13, 14 15, 16 17, 18 19}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Sometimes, you want to do something with an element as it gets
  kicked out.  For that, there is &lt;code&gt;lru-map-with&lt;/code&gt;.  This takes two
  extra arguments &amp;ndash; a function that operates on some &quot;state&quot; and the
  element that is getting kicked out and the initial &quot;state&quot;.  (Behind
  the scenes, this &quot;state&quot; isn&#39;t really state, but it is helpful to
  think of it as state.)
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt; lru-map-with 4 conj [] (&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf;&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt; 20))
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #708070;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #7f9f7f;&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt; {12 13, 14 15, 16 17, 18 19, :lru-state [[0 1] [2 3] [4 5] [6 7] [8 9] [10 11]]}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Again, this little package is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismgray/least-recently-used-map&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and the jar is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://clojars.org/least-recently-used-map&quot;&gt;clojars&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
