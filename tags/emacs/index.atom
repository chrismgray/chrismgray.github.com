	&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Probably a bad idea&amp;hellip; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  File this one in the category of crazy ideas had while running.  I
  was thinking about my new org-mode plugin that I announced &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com/posts/org-ikiwiki-plugin/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;
  and how hard it is to write in Emacs Lisp.  I was wishing that I
  could write it in Clojure instead.  Now, they&#39;re not &lt;b&gt;such&lt;/b&gt;
  different languages &amp;ndash; they both are evolutions of McCarthy&#39;s
  original lisp, but Clojure is a much prettier, less crufty
  language.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Let&#39;s look at just one construct in both languages: &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;.  In both
  languages, this assigns values to variable names locally. In elisp,
  it looks like:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-elisp&quot;&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;let*&lt;/span&gt; ((foo bar)
       (baz foo)))
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Instead of calling &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; there, I had to call &lt;code&gt;let*&lt;/code&gt;, so that the
  results of the first assignment were known to the second assignment.
  There is also a lot of parentheses there.  (Unparenthesized
  variables become automatically initialized to &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; I believe.  I
  don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great idea.)  Contrast this with Clojure&#39;s
  &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;color: #8cd0d3;&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; [foo bar
      baz foo])
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  To me, that&#39;s much more readable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Clojure&#39;s core libraries are also much more readable than most of
  elisp.  It seems to me that elisp was designed in the days where
  computer usage was charged by the letter and has not been updated
  since.  (Don&#39;t get me wrong &amp;ndash; I love Emacs and would rather program
  in elisp than Perl, but it has some warts.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Maybe not so crazy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Emacs already has a reader that can be used to turn lispy-looking
  things into lispy data structures.  Add some macros on top of that
  and you might be able to produce a &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; that&#39;s equivalent to
  Clojure&#39;s.  Since much of Clojure is written in Clojure (and all of
  Clojurescript is), defining the Clojure functions might just be a
  hop, skip, and jump away from that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Clojure could intern symbols into emacs (with namespaces prepended)
  and then emacs could use them.  Clojure could also call emacs
  functions directly &amp;ndash; any symbol that isn&#39;t defined in a Clojure
  namespace would be tested to see if it exists in emacs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Probably pretty crazy after all &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  One of Clojure&#39;s big selling points is its concurrency semantics.
  I don&#39;t follow emacs development very closely, but I don&#39;t think
  emacs is going to support any of that any time soon.  Also, would it
  be possible to compile the new language to elisp bytecode?  How
  would &lt;code&gt;recur&lt;/code&gt; work?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There are a lot of questions, and here I am working on a plugin for
  a combination of tools that hardly anyone uses.  But everyone has to
  scratch their own itch as they say.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Plugin for org files in ikiwiki</title>

	&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;A new plugin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Ikiwiki users who want to write org-mode files have long only had
  one plugin for ikiwiki to convert their files to html.  That plugin
  is good as it goes, but it is somewhat limited.  Thus, I am happy to
  announce a new plugin for converting org-mode.  It is located in my
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismgray/ikiwiki-org-plugin&quot;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It is still a bit rough around the edges, but it should be
  completely usable very soon.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;A new system &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  This is the obligatory post about how the new blogging system
  works.  Isn&#39;t that exciting?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  By my standards, this is a fairly simple system.  It is based on
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://ikiwiki.info&quot;&gt;ikiwiki&lt;/a&gt;, which allows me to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://orgmode.org&quot;&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; to edit my posts and &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com&quot;&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; as
  the version control system.  Since I already know those tools, I
  don&#39;t have to think about them and can just focus on writing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;m less comfortable with making web pages look nice, but I took the
  CSS file from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AntPortal/ikiwiked/raw/master/theme/gray-orange/local.css&quot;&gt;the nice people at antportal.com&lt;/a&gt; and added my own
  panoramic photo that I took while hiking.  I think the output is
  simple and looks pretty good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Finally, I am currently hosting the pages on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;What I intend to write about &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The blog is currently called &quot;Hiking and Coding&quot;.  So far I&#39;ve only
  written about the latter, but I&#39;m planning some posts about the
  former.  My current objective is to write once a day as a way to
  solidify what I&#39;m thinking about for the day, so my posts will
  likely be about what I&#39;m working on.  As such, expect them to be
  really boring.  I&#39;m okay with that.  I&#39;m also okay with you not
  subscribing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I will try to write about adventures I had while hiking on days that
  I&#39;m not really working on anything.  Those posts will be tagged with
  the hiking tag.  They might be more exciting (though they might
  not).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
