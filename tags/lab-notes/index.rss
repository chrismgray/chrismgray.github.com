&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Visibility Polygon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;ve put up some preliminary code for finding visibility polygons on
  my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismgray/visibility-polygon&quot;&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;.  I have only tested it with one polygon, but so far
  things are looking good.  My idea from yesterday of using monads to
  &quot;parse&quot; the polygon seems to be paying off.  Here is the relevant
  code:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(defn- add-new-pt [poly]
  (fn [pt stack]
    (when (or (empty? stack) ; First two points are guaranteed to be visible
              (empty? (rest stack))
              (visible? pt (first poly) (first stack)))
      [pt (rest poly) (cons (first poly) stack)])))

(defn- pop-stack [poly]
  (fn [pt stack]
    (let [the-seg (seg/new-seg pt (first poly))
          top-seg (seg/new-seg (first stack) (second stack))]
      (when (pt/left-turn? (second stack) (first stack) (first poly))
        (if (seg/intersection-on-seg? the-seg top-seg)
          [pt poly (cons (seg/intersection the-seg top-seg) stack)]
          [pt poly (rest stack)])))))

(defn- skip-pt [poly]
  (fn [pt stack]
   (let [the-seg (seg/new-seg pt (first stack))
         poly-seg (seg/new-seg (first poly) (second poly))]
     (when (not (pt/left-turn? (second stack) (first stack) (first poly)))
       (if (seg/intersection-on-seg? the-seg poly-seg)
         [pt (cons (seg/intersection the-seg poly-seg) (rest poly)) stack]
         [pt (rest poly) stack])))))

(defn- all-conditions [poly]
  (with-monad polygon-parser-m
    (m-plus (add-new-pt poly) (pop-stack poly) (skip-pt poly))))
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  This defines three actions to be performed when the polygon and
  stack are in certain configurations.  The first executes when the
  next point on the polygon doesn&#39;t obscure any of the stack.  In that
  case, it removes the point from &lt;code&gt;poly&lt;/code&gt; and puts it on &lt;code&gt;stack&lt;/code&gt;.  The
  second executes by popping points off the stack until the next point
  on the polygon no longer obscures the stack.  The final condition
  activates when the next point on the polygon is hidden by the
  stack.  It skips the points of &lt;code&gt;poly&lt;/code&gt; until it finds one that would
  be visible.  We combine the three conditions using &lt;code&gt;m-plus&lt;/code&gt;, which
  is defined to try the conditions in order until one returns
  something that is not &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Is this solution any better than a functional programming solution
  without monads?  I think it is.  First, the conditions are easy to
  see and very explicitly laid out.  Using a &lt;code&gt;cond&lt;/code&gt; to accomplish the
  same thing is certainly possible, but gets more complicated as the
  number of conditions grows.  Also, we are explicitly managing state
  in this solution.  Doing so in an ad-hoc manner would be much more
  difficult.  In fact, I am not really sure how I would loop until
  there are no more points in &lt;code&gt;poly&lt;/code&gt; in a solution without monads
  (especially since not all the conditions consume a point from
  &lt;code&gt;poly&lt;/code&gt;).  With monads, it is quite simple:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(defn- visibility-polygon-helper [pt poly]
  ((with-monad polygon-parser-m
     (m-until empty? all-conditions poly)) pt []))
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  Doing something like that with a &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; seems like it would veer
  off into unreadability fairly quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Are there downsides to this solution?  I think there is at least
  one.  That is, the conditions must be functions that return functions.
  This makes them a bit more confusing than they really should be.  I
  needed to do this so that I could have a test in the &lt;code&gt;m-until&lt;/code&gt;
  function above.  On the whole, though, this is a fairly cosmetic
  gripe, and can be hidden by using helper functions like the one
  above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;On the horizon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I would like to test the code quite a bit more.  However, doing so
  by drawing out polygons by hand and then figuring out their
  visibility polygons is quite tedious.  Therefore, I need some sort
  of GUI to be able to draw polygons and then I will be able to
  see whether the computed visibility polygon makes sense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I am thinking that it might be nice to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rosado/clj-processing&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;clj-processing&lt;/code&gt; library&lt;/a&gt; to do this.  Unfortunately, that library is currently only
  using Clojure 1.2.  Since I am using Clojure 1.3, that might be a
  problem.  So I might need to do some porting from 1.2 to 1.3.
  However, doing so should give me a good idea of how processing
  works, and could give a nice tool for more interactive geometry
  programs. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Functional programming &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;ve gotten a bit obsessed by functional programming over the last
  couple of years.  I have even seriously thought about writing a book
  that looks at computational geometry (which is the subject in which
  I was trained) in the light of functional programming.  Most of the
  standard computational-geometry texts these days approach the
  writing of code from an imperative standpoint.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I think functional programming is a good way to think about
  computational geometry for a couple of reasons.  First, most
  problems in computational geometry can be expressed in a purely
  functional manner.  That is, the answers to the problems are usually
  the same given the same inputs.  Secondly, I have bought into the
  idea that parallel and distributed computing are much easier when
  state is not being modified.  Functional programming forces you to
  think this way.  While many problems in computational geometry are
  inherently sequential, not all of them are.  Using a programming
  method that allows for the easy addition of more cores seems like a
  good practice when a problem is encountered that is easily made
  parallel. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One of the things I have been thinking about as a final chapter for
  the book that I would like to write is the introduction of monads as
  a way to &quot;parse&quot; polygons.  Monads are commonly used (well, commonly
  in the functional programming world) to parse strings.  They
  generally scan through with the aid of a stack.  There are many
  algorithms that scan through the points of a polygon with a stack --
  the example that I have thought about the most is the visibility
  polygon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Visibility polygons &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  A &lt;i&gt;visibility polygon&lt;/i&gt; is the subset of a polygon that can be &quot;seen&quot;
  from a point inside the polygon.  Here, we regard the segments of
  the polygon as opaque walls.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The standard algorithm for computing the visibility polygon is not
  too difficult to implement in an imperative language.  In fact, I
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.win.tue.nl/~cgray/ipelets.html&quot;&gt;implemented&lt;/a&gt; it already in C++ for the drawing editor &lt;a href=&quot;http://tclab.kaist.ac.kr/ipe/&quot;&gt;ipe&lt;/a&gt;.  (Though I
  think that code is now obsolete since the release of ipe 7.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;ve already tipped my hand at how I would think about implementing
  such an algorithm in a functional language.  I would use a variant
  of a monadic parser to go through the polygon and find the parts
  that are visible.  (That last sentence doesn&#39;t give much of a hint
  about how it&#39;s done, but the whole algorithm would take too much
  space to describe.  Suffice it to say that a stack is kept with the
  &quot;currently visible&quot; portion of the polygon always on the stack.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Monads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I used monads &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com/posts/time-series-2/&quot;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt; to make a framework for creating and comparing
  time-series.  However, I only used a monad that was already defined
  by someone else.  I think I might need to define a monad on my own
  this time &amp;ndash; a slightly daunting idea.  I definitely need to read
  the rest of &lt;a href=&quot;http://intensivesystems.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tutorials/monads_201.html&quot;&gt;Jim Duey&#39;s tutorial&lt;/a&gt; to make sense of how to do it.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Done! &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I was close with my guess in the last post.  What ended up working
  was
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(let [name (munge (symbol (str (-&amp;gt; env :ns :name) &lt;span&gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; (munge (str sym)))))
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  For some reason, &lt;code&gt;(name sym)&lt;/code&gt; would crash the compiler from the
  &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt; method but it wouldn&#39;t from other functions caled from the
  &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt; method.  I finally gave up worrying about that and just used
  &lt;code&gt;(str sym)&lt;/code&gt; instead, since that is guaranteed to be the same in this
  case &amp;ndash; there is an &lt;code&gt;(assert (not (namespace sym)))&lt;/code&gt; just before the
  &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; line.  I gave up on worrying about it, but someone who knows
  more about the compiler than me might want to try to figure out why
  it is.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I also needed to allow names defined in &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt; but redefined in
  another namespace to be called or referred to.  This involved
  changing the &lt;code&gt;resolve-existing-var&lt;/code&gt; function.  Again, &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt; is
  hardcoded:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(let [full-ns (if (and (core-name? env sym) (nil? (get-in @namespaces [(-&amp;gt; env :ns :name) :defs sym])))
                &#39;cljs.core
                (-&amp;gt; env :ns :name))]
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  I added the second test: it simply asks whether the variable has
  been defined in the namespace.  If it hasn&#39;t, and the variable is
  defined in &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt;, only then is the namespace set to
  &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Remove the macros &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  It was also necessary to remove many of the macros from &lt;code&gt;core.clj&lt;/code&gt;
  in order to redefine the functions that I needed to in my project.
  As I noted earlier, my project is to implement rationals in
  Clojurescript, so I need to redefine most of the functions that work
  with numbers.  (At least, that is the way I am implementing it --
  there may be a better way that I don&#39;t know about.)  Many of these
  functions were implemented twice: once as a macro in &lt;code&gt;core.clj&lt;/code&gt; and
  once as a function in &lt;code&gt;core.cljs&lt;/code&gt;.  I am obviously biased towards
  being able to redefine these functions, so I think the macros should
  be removed, but at least one of the implementations is redundant.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Resolving names as they are compiled in Clojurescript &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I think I found the bug in the Clojurescript compiler that I was
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com/more-rationals&quot;&gt;looking for yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.  Just to refresh the memory, when defining a
  function that has a function of the same name in &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt;, the
  compiler will assume that you are trying to redefine the function
  from &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt;, rather than the function in the namespace that you
  are actually in.  Since I am trying to redefine functions like &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;
  and &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, this is a problem.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Let&#39;s look at the evidence.  First, there&#39;s this:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(defmethod parse &#39;def
  [op env form name]
  (let [pfn (fn ([_ sym] {:sym sym})
              ([_ sym init] {:sym sym :init init})
              ([_ sym doc init] {:sym sym :doc doc :init init}))
        args (apply pfn form)
        sym (:sym args)]
    (assert (not (namespace sym)) &lt;span&gt;&quot;Can&#39;t def ns-qualified name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
    (let [name (munge (:name (resolve-var (dissoc env :locals) sym)))
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  The important line there is the last: when defining a new name,
  &lt;code&gt;resolve-var&lt;/code&gt; is called on the symbol.  Let&#39;s have a look at that
  function.  There is a &lt;code&gt;cond&lt;/code&gt;, and when none of the tests return
  true, the following is done:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(munge (symbol (str
                (if (core-name? env sym)
                  &#39;cljs.core
                  (-&amp;gt; env :ns :name))
                &lt;span&gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; (munge (name sym))))))]
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  This is seeing if the symbol name is in &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt;, and if it is
  setting the namespace of the symbol to &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt;.  Normally that
  would be correct &amp;ndash; one doesn&#39;t want to need to &lt;code&gt;use&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt; in
  every file &amp;ndash; but it doesn&#39;t allow for redefinition of functions
  that are in &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt; (at least without completely shadowing
  them).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;What to do &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  So what can we do about this?  The first thing that seems odd to me
  is that the symbol being defined is being resolved first.  Every
  symbol that is defined is defined within its own namespace, so there
  should be no need to resolve it.  That suggests that we should be
  able to take the part of &lt;code&gt;resolve-var&lt;/code&gt; that doesn&#39;t have a special
  case for &lt;code&gt;cljs.core&lt;/code&gt; and put it into the &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt; method.  Something
  like
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class=&quot;src src-clojure&quot;&gt;(let [name (munge (:name (symbol (str (-&amp;gt; env :ns :name) &lt;span&gt;&quot;.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; (munge (name sym))))))])
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;p&gt;
  might work in the &lt;code&gt;parse&lt;/code&gt; method.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;More about rationals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  While attempting to implement &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com/posts/rationals-in-cljs/&quot;&gt;support for rationals&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, I
  stumbled on what is (or at least, seems to me to be) a bug in the
  Clojure compiler itself.  That is, one can not refer to the function
  &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; in namespaces other than &lt;code&gt;clojure.core&lt;/code&gt;.  Now, this is probably
  the first time that anyone has wanted to do this, so it&#39;s not
  surprising that no one had seen the bug before.  But what was
  surprising to me was that I could fix it fairly easily.  I submitted
  my patch, and I should be a real-life contributor to Clojure pretty
  soon.  As a person who doesn&#39;t see himself as a compiler guy, that&#39;s
  pretty exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next problem that I&#39;m having is that redefining the basic
  arithmetic operations does not seem to work properly in
  Clojurescript.  The compiled javascript is trying (at least as far
  as I can tell) to redefine &lt;code&gt;cljs.core/+&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;rationals/+&lt;/code&gt;,
  for example.  This is the problem that I am going to try to solve
  today.  
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<description>&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;A small followup &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  My previous post said that I would be using the macros defined in
  Clojurescript&#39;s &lt;code&gt;core.clj&lt;/code&gt;.  It turns out that doesn&#39;t make a lot of
  sense.  I am using the functions defined in &lt;code&gt;core.cljs&lt;/code&gt; instead.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Rationals in Clojurescript &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Last night, I uploaded some code to compute the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram&quot;&gt;Voronoi Diagram&lt;/a&gt; of a
set of points to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismgray/voronoi-diagram/&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.  This post is not directly about that code --
I&#39;ll write about that when it is completely working &amp;ndash; but rather
about something that I noticed when I tried to convert the code to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript&quot;&gt;Clojurescript&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a few things that are known not to work in Clojurescript
that work in Clojure: I had to convert calls from &lt;code&gt;lazy-cat&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, for example.  However, the one difference that really broke
things for me was the lack of support for rational arithmetic in
Clojurescript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One major element of my algorithm is a test to determine whether a
given point is on a given line segment.  With integer coordinates for
the sites that determine the Voronoi Diagram and the bounding box,
everything about this test can be represented as a rational number.
Since Clojure gives you rational numbers by default, while
Clojurescript simply uses Javascript&#39;s arithmetic facilities, the test
works in Clojure but not in Clojurescript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what can be done about this?  Here are some options:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;sec-1-1&quot;&gt;Use floats, but more smartly &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     Probably the simplest option, here we would not test for &lt;i&gt;equality&lt;/i&gt;,
     but for &lt;i&gt;almost equality&lt;/i&gt;.  That is, if the distance between two
     points is a very small number (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt; a millionth), and all of the
     input is integer, then the two points are probably the same.  This
     option is obviously not too satisfying from a theoretical
     standpoint, especially if the small number is hardcoded.  I am
     fairly sure that there has been research to determine what the exact
     value of the small number should be, but that would take the code
     out of the realm of simplicity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;sec-1-2&quot;&gt;Implement rationals in Clojurescript &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     I am not sure how possible this option is.  However, it is currently
     the most appealing to me.  Rational arithmetic is not so difficult
     to implement, especially in the limited use case that I need it for:
     I am pretty sure that I could get away with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, and
     the comparison operators.  These are currently implemented as
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/3c83c62d973b0153a9e28bea7beb73794fbf9065/src/clj/cljs/core.clj#L51&quot;&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; in Clojurescript, which means that they take the
     Clojurescript code and change it Javascript code.  This allows
     the Clojurescript compiler to take the prefix syntax of
     Clojurescript and change it to the infix syntax of Javascript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     If we were to redefine the operators to be functions, we might
     have a chance to run different code given different types of
     input.  The &lt;code&gt;defmulti&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;defmethod&lt;/code&gt; macros seem perfect for
     this.  The major question is whether it is possible to shadow the
     names of the operators but use them nevertheless.  That is, will
     I be able to add &lt;code&gt;(:require-macros [clojure.core :as core])&lt;/code&gt; to
     my namespace and then use, for example, &lt;code&gt;core/*&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     The other downside, beyond the potential difficulties, is the
     fact that the generated Javascript will no longer be quite as
     pretty.  What used to be infix notation will be converted to
     function calls.  Additionally, there will be a fairly high
     penalty for doing arithmetic &amp;ndash; three or four function calls per
     arithmetic operation (assuming the polymorphic solution I have in
     mind works) rather than the current single operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I am going to try to implement the rationals in Clojurescript
  first.  At the very least, I will learn a bit more about how
  multimethods work in Clojure. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
