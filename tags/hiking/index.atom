&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Tehachapi to Walker Pass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  We left Tehachapi fairly late in the morning and both Garby and I
  were tired, so we walked fairly slowly.  It was already pretty late
  by the time we got to the start of Section F.  Section F starts with
  a long climb, and I for one was really glad to get to the top.  Once
  we were at the top, the wind mostly stopped, which was another
  relief.  However, it was easy to see from the trees that the wind
  blew at the top too:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GOpGag5worM/TnvDoAdKWpI/AAAAAAAACcQ/pHQm8vaQ-8Q/s144/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GOpGag5worM/TnvDoAdKWpI/AAAAAAAACcQ/pHQm8vaQ-8Q/s144/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We didn&#39;t go much farther that day.  We found a saddle out of the
  wind and set up camp.  There was a freak snowstorm the next
  morning.  It created an interesting juxtaposition: snow and cacti:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--k6BlHg_nyo/TnvD3WY0ISI/AAAAAAAACcU/3Nn-7Unb5S8/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--k6BlHg_nyo/TnvD3WY0ISI/AAAAAAAACcU/3Nn-7Unb5S8/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The snow only lasted long enough to make things cold and wet.  Soon
  enough, the heat was back.  Unfortunately, I am somewhat blanking on
  the exact places that I camped during this time.  I seem to be
  missing a day.  Judging from the dates on my pictures, the snow day
  was May 29.  I forget where I camped that night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day must have been more interesting though.  The bulk of it
  was spent on a rather tedious trudge across a desert-y landscape,
  but toward the end of the day we had gained some elevation and found
  ourselves amongst the Joshua Trees.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cdMF-02UuiM/TnvE9PZjg5I/AAAAAAAACcs/-SvpqRsgc5c/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cdMF-02UuiM/TnvE9PZjg5I/AAAAAAAACcs/-SvpqRsgc5c/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I sat and ate supper in the shade of a couple at around 4:00 and
  then hiked in the dusk, when it got a little cooler.  When I got to
  my destination (Bird Spring Pass), there was a cache of cool water,
  but only Joshua Trees on which to hang my hammock.  It felt a little
  wrong to do so, but it was actually a decent base.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day was one of my favorite kinds.  It began with a nice
  long climb, it was followed by a long mostly-flat section mostly in
  the woods, and ended with a descent.  At the end of the descent was
  Walker Pass, which has a campground and had trail magic that day.  I
  got some pizza and drinks and waited for Garby, who I had hiked past
  the previous day.  When he caught up, I asked whether he wanted to
  climb the next hill that evening or just stay at the campground.  I
  must admit that I was happy that he chose the latter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Walker Pass to Kennedy Meadows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The following day also began with a climb, but was supposed to end
  with a climb as well.  Garby and I ate a longish lunch at a stream
  near the base of the climb and we discussed where we would camp.
  After lunch, I let him go ahead of me as I normally do, but when I
  got to the place that I thought would be the campsite, I saw neither
  hide nor hair of him.  Thinking that I had perhaps misread the map,
  I kept going.  After an hour, I was sure that I had gone too far,
  but there was no turning back at that point.  I found a thicket of
  brushy trees and hung my hammock for the night, hoping that Garby
  wouldn&#39;t think that I had ditched him.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The mountains were pulling me in the next day.  All my pictures from
  the day are terrible because they are of the mountains in the
  distance.  (Except maybe this one, which is terrible only because
  the snake is so unimpressive:)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hvn7qZuSeXQ/TnvHKZRTViI/AAAAAAAADnY/Hsn80JIVTrE/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hvn7qZuSeXQ/TnvHKZRTViI/AAAAAAAADnY/Hsn80JIVTrE/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It was a decent day of hiking.  There was a burned area, which
  wasn&#39;t so nice, but I also saw a huge golden eagle, and then walked
  along the Kern river for a while, both of which were very nice.  I
  made it to Kennedy Meadows &amp;ndash; mile 700 &amp;ndash; by late afternoon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Kennedy Meadows is the last stop for hikers before the big
  mountains: The Sierra Nevada.  I had known when I started my journey
  that I would be getting there somewhat early, considering that 2011
  had been one of the highest snow years on record.  I knew that I
  should take a few days and try to wait for it to melt.  I ended up
  taking one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Garby, Lovebird, and Raven all showed up on my zero-day.  Garby was
  worryingly late &amp;ndash; he had gotten sick again and was not able to keep
  food down very well.  In the end, he took a couple of weeks off from
  the trail and came back feeling better and made quite a name for
  himself in the Sierras.  Kennedy Meadows was the last place that I
  saw him on the trail.  It turned out that we passed somewhat close
  to each other a couple more times, but I found out later that he got
  off the trail near the California/Oregon border with foot problems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The highlight of my zero-day was going to an alpaca farm with the
  rest of the gang.  I purchased an alpaca hat there that I wore for
  the rest of the trail (including some really cold nights in the
  mountains, where I was extremely glad to have it).  We hung out the
  rest of the day and even watched the movie Old School projected onto
  a big screen outdoors after it got dark.  It was a great day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Into the mountains, and more snow than I thought possible.  Hiking
  with a large group.  Defying death to get to the trail&#39;s highest
  point.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	
&lt;p&gt;After my zero at Hiker Heaven, I started on my way into the fifth
section of the trail, which is notable for containing about twenty
miles of actual desert.  Before this, everything that had seemed like
a desert was actually chaparral.  The map, usually shaded with green
and brown, was completely white.  But I am getting ahead of myself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Agua Dulce to the edge of the Mojave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  It is customary for PCT hikers to leave Hiker Heaven and then hike
  directly to the Anderson&#39;s, which is about 23 miles away.  Having
  just spent a very nice zero day at Hiker Heaven, I didn&#39;t feel any
  need to do that.  I was walking by myself and feeling good.  I had
  let Garby leave a little earlier than me, and knowing his speed, I
  was fairly confident that he would be ahead of me all day.  Some
  days you just want to walk alone.  I reached the road to the
  Anderson&#39;s in the early afternoon and decided to keep going.  Just
  past the road, I found a dead horny toad and took a picture of it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8X3kmfL8y8E/Tnu9q5-AZKI/AAAAAAAACac/LeTdqQGpbpc/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8X3kmfL8y8E/Tnu9q5-AZKI/AAAAAAAACac/LeTdqQGpbpc/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I walked five or six more miles that evening before finding a nice
  grove of trees with a small clearing inside for my hammock.  There
  was even a nice little stream nearby.  I did not catch up to Garby
  and was not sure if I would catch him again on the hike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was up early the next morning and walked about 100 yards when I
  came upon Garby packing up his campsite.  To me, it was a pretty
  good indication that we were really good hiking partners.  After
  nearly thirty miles of hiking, we had independently decided to call
  it a day within a distance that could be sprinted in 10 seconds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We passed the 500-mile marker that afternoon (though it was quite a
  distance past where the maps indicated that it should be).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vo6fdjs5_uY/Tnu_b6GGilI/AAAAAAAACbA/ffFV4E3X-s4/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vo6fdjs5_uY/Tnu_b6GGilI/AAAAAAAACbA/ffFV4E3X-s4/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The trail also became more wooded and shaded, which was nice because
  the weather was pretty hot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-r_5XUEmDZ3A/Tnu_sF5KHvI/AAAAAAAACbE/dUUMgHrHCsM/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-r_5XUEmDZ3A/Tnu_sF5KHvI/AAAAAAAACbE/dUUMgHrHCsM/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  And some of the trees had absolutely huge pine cones.  They were
  heavy too.  I kicked one, thinking that it would have the same
  papery weight that I am used to pine cones having, and nearly hurt
  my foot.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZuTaogQEfio/Tnu_74fePGI/AAAAAAAACbI/_rAU6IqEAQg/s640/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZuTaogQEfio/Tnu_74fePGI/AAAAAAAACbI/_rAU6IqEAQg/s640/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually, though, we descended from the forested ridge toward the
  desert.  A few miles before the desert actually starts, there is
  some private property with no camping allowed.  Garby and I decided
  to camp as close to that property line as possible and to get an
  early start the next morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;The Mojave&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  As we agreed, Garby and I got up at 3:30 in the morning and started
  walking toward the desert.  The moon was just past full, but it was
  not quite bright enough that we did not need our headlamps.  I had
  night-hiked &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/./../../posts/hiking/north-va&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, and did not really like it.  This time was a
  little better, but I still stumbled more than I would have liked.
  However, I knew that this was the best way to beat the heat of the
  desert.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We got to the LA aqueduct just after daybreak.  We filled our water
  containers to their capacity there and then started walking in a
  straight line.  The trail follows the aqueduct (which is mostly
  buried after your first encounter with it) across most of the
  desert.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o4F_F2AaOxY/TnvAnfsDv8I/AAAAAAAACbY/0pQAPGDwATs/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o4F_F2AaOxY/TnvAnfsDv8I/AAAAAAAACbY/0pQAPGDwATs/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It has a round top, which is slightly annoying to walk on, but it is
  better than sand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It&#39;s fairly hard to describe walking in the desert and make it seem
  exciting.  Nothing happens suddenly, like it can in the mountains.
  It is all very gradual.  Eventually you notice that it&#39;s gotten
  really oppressively hot.  Your water gets hot.  You want to sit
  down, but there&#39;s no point, because there&#39;s no shade anywhere.  It&#39;d
  just be a waste of time.  So you keep walking.  Eventually we came
  to a bridge that was about 2 feet off the ground, and I sat for
  about ten minutes in the meager amount of shade that it offered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Past the bridge, we walked on a road for a while.  We probably saw
  ten white trucks driving on the road, and no other vehicles.
  Clearly, this was a place where the only practical conveyance was a
  white truck.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It was only noon by the time we reached our destination.  This was a
  small stream with a bridge over it, a spigot with cool water, and a
  small piece of corrugated tin on the other side of the bridge acting
  as a generator of shade.  We put down our mats and tried to get some
  sleep.  By this time, I was not feeling very well and did not eat
  much for supper that afternoon. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Tehachapi Wind Farm and Sickness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning, we were up at 2:30 and repeated our night-hiking
  stunt from the morning before.  As we walked up the hill out of the
  desert, we hit an enormous head wind.  So we were walking up hill
  and into the wind &amp;ndash; not a pleasant experience.  On top of this, I
  was still not feeling well, so this part of the hike does not stick
  out as one of my favorite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We got lost a couple of times in the dark.  The trail follows an
  ill-defined network of roads that aren&#39;t really roads, and it was
  quite easy to get on the wrong one.  Eventually we found a campsite
  (with people still sleeping in it), so we knew we were on the right
  path.  It was also hard not to feel a little smug, knowing that we
  had already walked about 10 miles and were passing people who were
  not yet awake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As we walked on, the wind was a near-constant annoyance.  However,
  we would see that it had a real use.  We walked straight into one of
  the largest wind farms in the world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZYF-QpSOFXo/TnvCMkzT_AI/AAAAAAAACb4/Ur-o8Mh4KzY/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZYF-QpSOFXo/TnvCMkzT_AI/AAAAAAAACb4/Ur-o8Mh4KzY/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  By early afternoon, we had made it to a road, and I was beat.  It
  was not our destination, but the combination of not feeling well and
  the early rising of the previous days killed my energy.  Garby
  caught up with me, and together we decided to hitch into town.  We
  needed to go to the post office, and as soon as that business was
  taken care of, we got a hotel room and turned the air conditioner
  on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It turned out that Garby had caught whatever it was that I had.  It
  seemed like he still ate as much as usual, but he threw it up
  shortly thereafter.  I managed to moderate my eating so that I
  wouldn&#39;t throw up, but it was easy to decide that we needed to
  recuperate a little, so we took another zero.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-4&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Leaving Tehachapi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The nice lady who had given us a ride from the post office to the
  hotel had also given us her phone number and told us to call if we
  needed anything.  Neither of us felt like hitching out of town, so
  we took her up on it.  I think she was a bit surprised to hear from
  us again, but she was game.  On our way out of town, she took us
  past a friend&#39;s farm where a bison had just given birth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fB3OXL1RI_k/TnvC0SftiCI/AAAAAAAACcA/NU7-CBFafo0/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fB3OXL1RI_k/TnvC0SftiCI/AAAAAAAACcA/NU7-CBFafo0/s800/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  After plenty of ooh-ing and aah-ing, we got back to the trail and
  started hiking again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We walked through the remainder of the wind farm and across a
  highway, and we left the section.  Of all the hiking that I did,
  that might have been my least favorite section.  It was constantly
  hot (though I actually got somewhat lucky with the weather &amp;ndash; others
  had it much hotter than I did), and both I and my hiking partner got
  sick.  The first two days weren&#39;t bad, but the last two certainly
  made up for that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-5&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-5&quot;&gt;Next Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-5&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I may combine the next section with half of the following one so
  that I get to the start of the Sierras.  I&#39;m as excited to write
  about my experience in the Sierras as I was to get to them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Section C ended with a couple of rainy days before a night at a Best
Western at Cajon Pass.  It was a restful night, and before long we
were on the trail again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Cajon Pass to Wrightwood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Most passes on the trail are higher than the trail around them, but
  Cajon Pass is the opposite.  So we had another day of climbing ahead
  of us.  This day was more than 5000 feet over about 22 miles.  So
  not very steep, but still a grind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As I went higher, the landscape changed from desert and chaparral to
  more of a forest.  It also became clear that we were reaching
  elevations where it could snow if there was any precipitation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SZ19p5esr9U/Tdk5s92ISgI/AAAAAAAABf4/6uz_7f9FouU/s800/DSCF0572.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SZ19p5esr9U/Tdk5s92ISgI/AAAAAAAABf4/6uz_7f9FouU/s800/DSCF0572.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Given that we had had bad weather over the past couple of days, this
  was a real concern.  The picture above has clouds in it, and I was
  monitoring them all day.  The plan for the day was to end near a
  trail going to the town of Wrightwood and then to spend the next day
  in Wrightwood.  If bad weather hit, we would go into Wrightwood that
  night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  What happened was a bit more complicated than that.  When we got to
  the top of the hill, the weather wasn&#39;t great.  The wind was blowing
  fiercely, and it was cold and cloudy, but there was no
  precipitation.  Morevover, we were at a campground with an outhouse
  that all the campers could pile into if the weather got truly
  awful.  Even though the outhouse didn&#39;t smell great, we would do it
  if we had to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We didn&#39;t have to, but I awoke the next morning to freezing rain.
  On the trail, I&#39;m generally an early riser, so I was out of camp
  before the others that were camping at the site with me.  Even
  though the trail to town was behind us, I decided to hike to the
  road that was about five miles ahead of us.  I guess I was in a bit
  of a masochistic mood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As I walked down the trail, ice balls as big as cantaloupes fell
  from the trees around me.  The freezing rain was accompanied by a
  strong wind, and it felt like someone was sandblasting my face.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-njjbEhDW0l0/Tdk5_KJN01I/AAAAAAAABgE/ckXeQPMWtq4/s800/DSCF0574.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-njjbEhDW0l0/Tdk5_KJN01I/AAAAAAAABgE/ckXeQPMWtq4/s800/DSCF0574.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  After a while, the trail was covered by snow and ice, and staying on
  it became more difficult.  At one point, I kept going straight after
  it had turned and ended up at a ski hill.  There was a nearby
  maintenance shed, and I stood in its wind shadow to warm up a bit
  and read my maps.  I was near the trail, so I got back on it.  After
  another half mile or so, I was still at the ski hill, but I found a
  warming shed.  The ski hill was closed for the season, but the
  heater in the shed still worked, so I had a chance to warm up for
  real.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  At that point, I knew I had two options.  I could either try to stay
  on the trail, or I could go down the ski run that I was sitting at
  the top of.  It is a truism that if you go down a ski run, you will
  eventually find a road at the end, so I knew that would work.  As I
  said, I was having trouble staying on trail, so it was an attractive
  option.  Looking back on it, going down the ski run would probably
  have been smarter, but I decided to try to stay on the trail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I did get slightly lost a couple more times, but eventually I found
  my way to the road.  As I descended, the weather got better (just
  rain and not freezing rain), but I was still pretty cold and wet by
  the time I got there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Unbeknownst to me, the road was closed in the direction that traffic
  would be coming towards town, so hitching was &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; hard.  Since
  I was cold and wet, I decided to keep moving, and walk towards
  town.  A few miles down the road there was an intersection which
  meant that finally there would be traffic in the correct direction
  on the road, so I got a hitch the rest of the way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I had a nice time in Wrightwood, where I stayed in a room with Holden and
  (Head)Banger.  We went out for Mexican food at a place that
  advertised 5 cent margaritas with your meal.  Of course, only the
  first was 5 cents, but Holden didn&#39;t realize that.  Or perhaps he
  didn&#39;t want to realize it because it was his birthday.  In any case,
  he had quite a few of them, and it was a pretty fun night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Mount Baden-Powell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  After a large pancake breakfast, I got a ride back to the trail.
  The first half of the day was flat and easy, and then I got to Mount
  Baden-Powell.  Initially, it was easy too, though steeper than most
  of the trail we had encountered so far, and then I got to the
  snow.  Even that didn&#39;t seem too bad &amp;ndash; someone had gone up it on
  skis, so the trail was easy to follow.  I met another hiker on the
  way up (I can&#39;t for the life of me remember his trail name), and we
  decided to stick together going up the mountain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f0WndvmwhK8/Tdk6NjGRdRI/AAAAAAAADO4/H1NMH8DyaT4/s800/DSCF0576.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f0WndvmwhK8/Tdk6NjGRdRI/AAAAAAAADO4/H1NMH8DyaT4/s800/DSCF0576.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Near the top of the mountain, the PCT turns and traverses the face
  of the mountain, and another trail keeps going to the top.
  Traverses are scarier to me than ridge walking, so we took the trail
  to the top.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CBjbZoP7fWA/Tdk68VDz2DI/AAAAAAAABhQ/mwhBNd_L0rk/s800/DSCF0584.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CBjbZoP7fWA/Tdk68VDz2DI/AAAAAAAABhQ/mwhBNd_L0rk/s800/DSCF0584.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Now here is where things get funny.  As you can see in the picture
  above, there was quite a fog that day.  So, following footsteps
  rather than our compasses, we went down the wrong ridge.  In the
  picture below, we were supposed to follow the red line, but we
  followed the orange one instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/./../../posts/hiking/mountainmishap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/../../posts/hiking/mountainmishap.png&quot; alt=&quot;mountainmishap.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We followed the ridge for maybe three hours, losing elevation the
  whole time.  Eventually, we hit an area that we couldn&#39;t pass and
  knew that we were lost.  What we didn&#39;t know was just how lost we
  were.  We started scouting around for the trail, going back to
  places where we had last seen footprints, and following animal paths
  to dead ends.  By the time we got our compasses out, we were off the
  map, but it didn&#39;t matter.  It was clear that we were going the
  wrong direction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Before we figured out exactly what had happened, Garby happened upon
  us.  He had gone down the path to Wrightwood rather than the road,
  so he had been a few hours behind us all day.  He had seen our
  footprints and assumed that we were going the right way.  So now
  there were three of us that were lost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Once Garby showed up, though, we figured out what had happened
  pretty quickly.  It was clear that we would have to walk all the way
  back up Mount Baden-Powell, and go down the correct ridge.  By this
  time, however, the sun was setting, so we needed to camp.  It was a
  new experience for me, camping while lost.  It was not particularly
  pleasant.  I remember getting up during the night and seeing that
  the fog had cleared.  The moon was bright, and I could see the ridge
  that we needed to walk down.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We were all up early the next morning, partly because we wanted to
  be back on the trail and officially un-lost, and partly because we
  were all almost out of water.  We hiked back up the mountain and
  down the correct ridge to a beautiful spring, with water coming out
  of the side of the mountain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Let me take a quick diversion here to talk about the process of
  hiking, rather than the journey.  On the AT I resisted technology
  for a long time.  On the PCT, however, I started the trail with an
  mp3 player.  I would charge and refill it with podcasts every chance
  that I got.  Some people hate any technology on the trail (except
  all the technologically-advanced stuff that they carry on their
  back, but I digress even further), but I think that listening to
  podcasts really helped me cement the experience in my brain.  I have
  trail memories triggered by my favorite podcasts all the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I can picture exactly where I was when I was listening to the guys
  on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebuglepodcast.com/&quot;&gt;The Bugle&lt;/a&gt; make fun of the hype surrounding the royal wedding.
  And now, whenever they mention it, I picture that place.  When I was
  going up the hill out of Cajon Pass, I was listening to an interview
  on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/&quot;&gt;Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt; with a couple who filmed lions.  On the way down Mount
  Baden-Powell, I was listening to Tig Notaro on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/jordan-jesse-go&quot;&gt;Jordan, Jesse, Go&lt;/a&gt;.  I
  heard Tig on another podcast the other day and immediately thought
  of the whole experience.  Even more than a year later, these are
  completely vivid memories, and I think the fact that I was making
  mental connections between what I was listening to and the place
  that I was hiking through helped that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  So anyway to distill it to two words: podcasts good.  Just always
  have one earbud out if you are walking in a place that could have
  snakes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-4&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Frog Detour and Station Fire Burn area&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The next couple of days are a bit of a blur (though I could tell you
  what I listened to).  It was a beautiful area, but perhaps the
  slightly traumatic experience of getting so lost pushed the memories
  out of my head.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  One thing that does stick out is a long road walk to detour around
  the habitat of an endangered species of frog.  I later heard that
  horseback riders are likely more damaging to the frogs&#39; habitat than
  hikers, so I would have been fine going through the detour, but I
  did the detour in any case.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The day after the frog-detour day, the trail went through the burn
  zone of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Fire_(2009)#Los_Angeles_County&quot;&gt;Station Fire&lt;/a&gt;.  An act of arson, this fire had been so
  bad that it burned down the ranger station.  They were rebuilding
  at the time that we were there, which is a good thing to see, but a
  burn zone is a pretty sad thing for me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-4-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-4-1&quot;&gt;Boris&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-4-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/./../../posts/hiking/socal-03&quot;&gt;last section&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that there was a funny story with
   Boris and LoL.  Around the frog detour, just past Mount
   Baden-Powell, LoL went into the bushes to go to the bathroom and
   Boris passed him without LoL knowing it.  Boris was in the zone,
   moving fast, and even though he and LoL had been hiking together,
   he didn&#39;t wait around for LoL.  With his head down, he even missed
   a turn and went a little way on a wrong path before realizing it
   and bushwhacking down to the correct path.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   After half a day of not seeing his buddy, LoL got concerned.
   Assuming that Boris was behind him, LoL decided to wait for Boris.
   When he got word from hikers behind him that they had seen a place
   where a hillside had been torn up and it looked like someone had
   fallen down the mountain, LoL had all the reason he needed to panic
   and call in search and rescue.  They sent a team to the place where
   the possible fall had been seen, but found no Boris.  They had
   sheriffs go to all the campgrounds in the area and yell his name
   (one of them woke me up).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Boris was at the same campground as Garby, about 10 miles ahead of
   me, and had no idea that so much was going on in his honor.  When
   he found out, he was mightily embarrassed, and that&#39;s how he got
   his trail name of Overdrive.  My theory is that he didn&#39;t want to
   be associated with the name that the sheriffs had been yelling.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-5&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-5&quot;&gt;Vasquez Rocks and Hiker Heaven&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-5&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  It had been an eventful section, and there were two last treats.
  The first was the Vasquez Rocks.  Huge weather-worn rocks sticking
  out of the desert, they epitomize what I think of as a western
  scene.  For good reason, it turns out.  They have been used in
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_productions_using_the_Vasquez_Rocks_as_a_filming_location&quot;&gt;quite a lot of movies and TV shows&lt;/a&gt; that want to have a &quot;Western&quot;
  location.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z88b0OU1DKE/Tdk8D_-Gn5I/AAAAAAAABiI/wBHthUwP2j0/s800/DSCF0595.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z88b0OU1DKE/Tdk8D_-Gn5I/AAAAAAAABiI/wBHthUwP2j0/s800/DSCF0595.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It is quite a touristy location, to the extent that they even have
  placards along the path identifying the flora.  I was a bit
  surprised to see that they even had one identifying poison oak.  I
  would think that it would be easier to remove the poison oak than to
  put up a sign saying what it is, but I guess that shows what I know.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-5-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-5-1&quot;&gt;Hiker Heaven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-5-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   Just past the Vasquez Rocks is a hostel appropriately named Hiker
   Heaven.  It&#39;s run by the Saufleys, who are a great couple who
   happen to have a large yard and love hikers.  I took a zero there,
   and got a ride to an outfitter near LA where I got a couple of
   things that I had been needing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  Into the real desert.  Night-hiking to avoid the sun.  Going by
  another wind farm.  Feeling sick.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;A bit of news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  This blog has been pretty quiet lately, because I recently moved
  from Calgary to sunny California.  I took a job with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starviewinc.com/&quot;&gt;Starview&lt;/a&gt; in San
  Jose, and I&#39;m living nearby in Sunnyvale.  Things are going really
  well with the job, and I&#39;ve been working hard so that I can make an
  impact right out of the gate.  Of course, that cuts down on the time
  that I have for writing blogs.  So that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been up to.  On
  with the story of the hike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Cabazon to Big Bear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Section B ends in an ugly way under an interstate highway overpass.
  It&#39;s sandy, and that&#39;s hard to walk on.  By the time we got there,
  it was already after noon, and mighty hot.  A wall of clouds loomed,
  but it was easy to disregard them, considering that we were still in
  what could easily be considered desert.  The clouds were to one side
  and Palm Springs was on the other.  We were moving closer to Palm
  Springs, so there was no way it was going to rain.  (Have you
  guessed that it&#39;s going to rain yet?)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As we walked, we came nearer to a wind farm, the first of two that
  we would walk past on our hike.  It is a little hard to imagine how
  large the turbines are when you just see them fleetingly as you
  drive past, but when you walk near them, you get the full
  experience.  They aren&#39;t messing around.  There is a little man-made
  oasis near a maintenance truck by the wind farm where there is shade
  and refreshments, so we took a break and tended to our feet for a
  while before we started moving again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vQn_UOPq5WE/Tdk4j0aSxaI/AAAAAAAABeo/uA1H-sRNowg/s800/DSCF0561.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vQn_UOPq5WE/Tdk4j0aSxaI/AAAAAAAABeo/uA1H-sRNowg/s800/DSCF0561.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  A little after we left, it started raining.  At first it was a
  relief.  We had been walking under completely blue skies in Southern
  California for around two weeks, and the variety was nice.  However,
  I had been expecting the blue skies and had not packed any rain gear
  for this part of the journey (I sent it all to the beginning of the
  Sierras).  So after a while, even my fleece was getting
  waterlogged.  Our plan upon leaving the oasis had been to try to get
  to a fish hatchery that was about a half a mile off-trail.  Since it
  would clearly be the only shelter for miles, it became a must.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I had been hiking in the vicinity of Garby, Raven, and Lovebird all
  day, and we met up near where we thought the junction with the
  fish-hatchery trail would be.  In fact, I thought that we were at
  the junction because I was misreading the map.  In my defense, it&#39;s
  pretty hard to read a map through a plastic bag in a hard rain, but
  that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I was misreading the map.  I was
  lucky that Raven was more persuasive than me, and convinced us to go
  on until we actually found the junction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually we made it to the fish hatchery, where there was shelter
  (a gazebo-like structure for tourists to picnic under).  We had gone
  over 27 miles on the day &amp;ndash; more than 1% of the trail.  I quickly
  set up my hammock between two beams of the gazebo, but the setup
  wasn&#39;t optimal, and the wind kept waking me up throughout the night
  by flapping the tarp.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day was almost completely uphill.  The rain was gone and it
  was hot once again.  I got an early start, but that only gets you so
  much.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uXHQpSRVdnY/Tdk4tpTOZJI/AAAAAAAABes/Zg3tvddCOsE/s800/DSCF0562.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uXHQpSRVdnY/Tdk4tpTOZJI/AAAAAAAABes/Zg3tvddCOsE/s800/DSCF0562.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We walked up the basin formed by a creek for almost the whole day.
  By the end of the day, we had climbed around 5000 feet.  It was cold
  at night at that altitude and there were pine trees.  We ran into
  some fun people at the camp site, most notably Love it or Leave it
  (abbreviated LoL) and Hercules.  Hercules will show up again much
  later in the story, but we will meet LoL and his friend Boris (aka
  Overdrive) again much sooner.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  After our long climb, Garby and I kept the next day nice and easy,
  setting ourselves up for a nearo into the town of Big Bear.  We
  found a nice camp at around 3 and then just rested for the remainder
  of the day.  We even made a camp fire.  Unfortunately, Lovebird had
  shin splints, so he and Raven hitched in to Big Bear by an alternate
  road before our camp.  We would see them in town, but it was the
  last I would hike with them for quite a while.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  On the Appalachian Trail, you can tell that you are having a good
  day if you can do &quot;12 by 12&quot;.  That is, 12 miles by noon.  Garby and
  I had 9 miles to go to get to the road into Big Bear the next day
  and we made it by 9 o&#39;clock.  9 by 9 is so much better than 12 by
  12 that I was pretty impressed, but perhaps it&#39;s one of those things
  that doesn&#39;t really translate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anyway, we spent the day in Big Bear.  It&#39;s a very spread-out town,
  which makes it bad for hikers, so I won&#39;t say too much about it.
  (Other than to note that it has the smallest ski hill I think I&#39;ve
  ever seen.  Seriously, there must be sand dunes that are bigger.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Big Bear to Cajon Pass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Following our day in Big Bear, we must have walked for a while, but
  I don&#39;t remember it at all.  So I&#39;ll skip it.  The day after that,
  we made one of our biggest mistakes on the trail.  A section of the
  trail was closed due to a rock slide, and an alternate route was
  given.  We took the alternate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  At first, it didn&#39;t look too bad. It was mostly on dirt roads, but
  there wasn&#39;t any traffic.  However, we soon turned off the dirt road
  onto off-road-vehicle roads.  It was a Friday, and the off-roaders
  were out in force.  There were vehicles of all shapes and sizes from
  dirt bikes to Hummers.  Every 20 minutes or so, there would be a
  procession of them.  The passengers would hold up their fingers
  indicating how many more were coming, which is thoughtful, but also
  disheartening.  &quot;Really, there are 7 more of you jerks disrupting my
  day?&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We ate lunch by a little creek and I got some water out of it,
  upstream of its crossing with the road.  It was a good thing that I
  did, because as we were eating lunch, three Jeeps came to the
  creek.  We sat and watched as they crossed and re-crossed the creek
  4 or 5 times, a different passenger getting out and taking video of
  the crossing each time.  It was maddening.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We later heard that if we had not taken the alternate, the trail
  would have been beautiful and the rock slide not too bad.  Also,
  Deep Creek, which is where the trail went, is a natural hot spring
  that is clothing-optional.  The day that we missed it, there was a
  rumored nude photo shoot there.  Now of course this is a only trail
  rumor, so who knows if it&#39;s true, but it sure sounds like the kind
  of thing that I would have liked to have verified for myself.  For
  science, of course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anyway, by the end of the long day, we finished the alternate route
  and were back on the trail.  We met an older lady, and being a bit
  dumb, I didn&#39;t realize who she was until she was already gone.  Her
  name is Mother Goose, and she is an a true trail legend.  She is
  still going strong &amp;ndash; according to her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postholer.com/mothergoose&quot;&gt;trail journal&lt;/a&gt;, she is hiking
  the PCT again this year.  I set up my hammock in some scrubby trees
  on a hillside and it rained again at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It kept raining the next morning, and I got as colder as the day
  went on.  My strategy in situations like that is generally to push
  on and keep moving so that I generate body heat.  That day, however,
  it was really bad.  It just never let up.  Eventually I met up with
  Garby at an underpass where we found some shelter from the rain.  I
  tried to tear open a pack of crackers, but my fingers were so cold
  that they had lost the strength required even for that.  Out of the
  rain, we warmed up again, and eventually found the courage to hike
  on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It didn&#39;t rain much longer that day, and before long we were drying
  our tarps in the sun.  The terrain also became more deserty again,
  which was heartening.  I was really tired of rain by that point.  I
  had not expected it or packed for it.  Even when you&#39;re ready for
  it, cold rain isn&#39;t much fun, but when you&#39;re not ready for it, it&#39;s
  downright awful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Anyway, in the afternoon, we walked by some very windy cliffs to
  Cajon Pass.  It sounds nice, but it&#39;s really a McDonald&#39;s and a Best
  Western at a highway rest stop.  I got my customary chocolate shake,
  and a room at the Best Western.  I was tired from the long days
  and walking in the rain, so I slept deeply.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-4&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Snow and ice.  Getting really lost.  Finally getting back to normal
  weather and having to take a &quot;frog detour&quot;.  Boris and LoL get up to
  some shenanigans that keep people up at night.  Finally, we meet
  some of the nicest trail angels around.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Warner Springs to Idyllwild&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Leaving Warner Springs, my feet were getting tired.  I had started
  with shoes that had almost no padding (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IHNHQK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004IHNHQK&quot;&gt;Merrell Trail Glove&lt;/a&gt;), and
  it was turning out that they were too minimal for the task at hand.
  They were fine for forests, but the rocky desert that I was walking
  on was not forgiving enough.  I had ordered some of my favorite
  trail runners to be sent to a cafe that was a couple of days away,
  though, so I was keen to get there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The first day out of Warner Springs, I met up with the group of
  three ladies that I met the day before Warner Springs.  We made it
  to a water tank by the early afternoon and then sat and shot the
  breeze during the really hot part of the day.  Annie&#39;s blisters were
  still really bad, but she had gotten epsom salts in town, and she
  spent quite a while soaking her feet in a plastic bag.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We eventually hiked on, but it was starting to get dark quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2OWhQv6J7RU/Tdk1sPcwPXI/AAAAAAAABcE/tiQCf5BoyCQ/s640/DSCF0533.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2OWhQv6J7RU/Tdk1sPcwPXI/AAAAAAAABcE/tiQCf5BoyCQ/s640/DSCF0533.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually we got to a spot with some flat areas where tents could
  be set up.  Unfortunately for me, there were no trees where I could
  hang my hammock, so I had to &quot;cowboy camp&quot;.  It&#39;s a pretty common
  thing to do, especially on the PCT, where there is very little
  rain.  Basically, it is camping without any shelter.  I put the tarp
  of my hammock down and my mat and sleeping back on top of it.  The
  bugs were pretty bad (I kept Annie awake by slapping at mosquitoes),
  and the ground was a lot less comfortable than my hammock, but I
  made it through the night.  Thankfully, it was one of the very few
  times that I was forced to sleep on the ground during the whole
  trip.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day was, for me, a big day.  I wanted to get to the cafe as
  quickly as possible to get my shoes.  We started early, but before
  long it was hot again.  Raven, Lovebird, and Garby, who had all left
  Warner Springs a bit after I had, caught and passed me.  Eventually
  we all met at a water cache and again tried to wait out the sun.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I found that I couldn&#39;t wait.  New shoes were just too close and too
  tantalizing.  It was really hot, but they would have cold drinks at
  the cafe.  I walked on, up and down hills, and across dirt roads
  with no trail magic until I finally got to the top of a hill where I
  could see the road with the cafe.  I could see Annie ahead of me, and
  I knew that she would have no trouble getting a ride.  I was also
  really excited about the cafe.  So I started running down the hill
  towards the road.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Annie really had no trouble getting the ride &amp;ndash; I think someone
  stopped before she had enough put out her thumb, so I was on my
  own.  Before long Raven and Lovebird showed up and the three of us
  got a ride together.  After a short ride, we were at Paradise Valley
  Cafe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Paradise Valley Cafe really is a paradise, especially for
  thru-hikers.  First, it has one of the best waitresses I have ever
  seen.  She was a marvel of efficiency, giving us ice water as soon
  as we came in and refilling our drinks well before they ran dry.
  She was even reading hiking books in an effort to connect better
  with her clientele.  It also has really good burgers (of course I
  got the veggie patty), and is in a really beautiful location.  What
  made me the happiest, though, was my new shoes.  After 150 miles of
  shoes with no padding at all, they felt like walking on cushions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually we had to leave paradise.  It was late, and there was a
  little trail behind the cafe back to the PCT, so I walked down that
  until I found a couple of trees where I could hang my hammock.  All
  the trees were too big or too far apart until I got nearly all the
  way to the trail.  Even then, I had to be very creative to make the
  hammock work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was up early the next day and moving a lot faster.  We were
  heading into the San Jacinto mountains, and the elevation gain meant
  that we would get some respite from the heat.  Down below was the
  desert and Palm Springs, and I was glad not to be there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ycRPfwUCUxk/Tdk2gFfAcQI/AAAAAAAABc8/UMgJkDT8O-U/s800/DSCF0541.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ycRPfwUCUxk/Tdk2gFfAcQI/AAAAAAAABc8/UMgJkDT8O-U/s800/DSCF0541.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3G_8V1I7vcg/Tdk3S3oDeqI/AAAAAAAABdg/1RSwB_PPTPU/s800/DSCF0549.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3G_8V1I7vcg/Tdk3S3oDeqI/AAAAAAAABdg/1RSwB_PPTPU/s800/DSCF0549.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I slept on the side of a mountain that night, and the next morning
  came to some snow-covered trail.  At that point, it was still enough
  of a novelty that I took a picture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q7sN1vpeiXg/Tdk39Isin5I/AAAAAAAABeA/piFJkqioW0U/s800/DSCF0555.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Q7sN1vpeiXg/Tdk39Isin5I/AAAAAAAABeA/piFJkqioW0U/s800/DSCF0555.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LXdf2CTd3m8/Tdk4QqnTBLI/AAAAAAAABeY/folE9Emn3AE/s800/DSCF0558.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LXdf2CTd3m8/Tdk4QqnTBLI/AAAAAAAABeY/folE9Emn3AE/s800/DSCF0558.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Later that day I made it down a steep side trail to Idyllwild, and
  met up with the rest of the crew.  We had a Mexican feast and
  listened to some really good live music until &quot;hiker midnight&quot; (9
  PM).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Fuller Ridge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Up early the next day to hike back up the side trail.  We had more
  snow ahead of us, and the dreaded Fuller Ridge.  People had been
  hyping Fuller Ridge for at least 50 miles, and as with most things
  in life, it didn&#39;t live up to the hype.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Though I&#39;m writing about it now with some bravado, I must admit that
  I was glad to be with a group.  Even better was having Lovebird and
  Raven in the group, who are from the Yukon and have a lot of
  experience hiking on snow.  Garby showed me how to shorten one
  hiking pole while walking on the side of a ridge, but all in all
  Fuller Ridge really wasn&#39;t that bad.  The most difficult thing was
  navigating on the snow.  We had a good idea of where we were on the
  map, and using some intuition and my altimeter watch, we were able
  to stay at the right elevation.  When we walked over the wilderness
  sign that was buried almost to its top in the snow, we knew we were
  at the right place.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We ended the day at a trailhead whose elevation was not much
  different from the top of the ridge.  It had already been raining a
  bit during the day, and it continued into the night.  Because of the
  elevation, it froze over night and I awoke to find a thin layer of
  ice covering my hammock&#39;s tarp.  Since my new shoes were frozen, I
  wore my old ones for a while that morning as we started our
  descent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The descent from Fuller Ridge is kind of amazing.  The factoid on
  the map states that it&#39;s 4.3 miles in a straight line but 15.2 miles
  on the trail.  It&#39;s just one switchback after another.  It&#39;s a
  little boring, but we made quick work of it.  We got to the bottom
  by noon.  We had lost about 7000 feet of elevation in the morning
  and were in the boiling heat of the sun once more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Some editing will be in order if I ever want to finish writing about
  this hike.  I remember it all so vividly, though, and I enjoy
  reliving the details.  Anyway, we will go past a wind farm and get
  caught in the rain.  We will miss some of the best sights on the
  trail because we stupidly followed the law and took a marked
  detour.  And a Best Western will never have seemed so good after a
  tough day with some more rain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	
&lt;p&gt;Here we go on the first post of my recap of my experience on the
Pacific Crest Trail.  It&#39;s been nearly a year since I started, and I
didn&#39;t keep records of where I stayed as well as on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/./../AT&quot;&gt;AT&lt;/a&gt;, so this
recap will probably be a bit less detailed than that one (which might
be a good thing).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here&#39;s the obligatory &quot;before&quot; photo:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4xYuJjCRfeo/TdkxHjmx2MI/AAAAAAAABXU/8_DU5RSDSio/s800/DSCF0494.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4xYuJjCRfeo/TdkxHjmx2MI/AAAAAAAABXU/8_DU5RSDSio/s800/DSCF0494.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Across the wall behind me is Mexico.  My shirt is clean, my pack&#39;s
color is vivid, and my face is clean-shaven.  None of those things
would be true for very long on this hike.  I had arrived at the border
at around 6:30 PM, so I didn&#39;t plan to go very far that evening.  I
passed the first mile-marker on my way to the small town near the
trailhead:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ia1Kk0DJplw/TdkxihMR9VI/AAAAAAAABX0/fR580G6sFbQ/s640/DSCF0495.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ia1Kk0DJplw/TdkxihMR9VI/AAAAAAAABX0/fR580G6sFbQ/s640/DSCF0495.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had food with me, but no water.  The store owner (because the town
was little more than a convenience store) made me buy water.  Since
Southern California is mostly a desert, I felt it was the best idea to
go along with it.  I walked a bit longer (I made maybe about three
miles on the first evening), found a place to set up my hammock, made
supper and went to bed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day really showed the rigors of desert hiking.  With the sun
beating down and hardly any shade, it wasn&#39;t long before things got
really hot.  I heard my first rattlesnake in bushes nearby, but I just
kept trudging on.  At lunchtime, though, I found a bit of shade at the
bottom of a hill near a flowing stream.  There was another hiker there
with the trail name Hikeaholic.  He had hiked the PCT before and had
even been a maintainer of the trail in Washington, and he was quite
encouraging about my chances.  After lunch, we parted ways, and I went
on to the Lake Morena campsite for the first day of what is known as
the Kickoff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://adzpctko.org&quot;&gt;Kickoff&lt;/a&gt; is an annual event where many of the northbound hikers
(which is just about everyone on the PCT) get together.  Gear
companies show up along with trail &quot;alumni&quot; who want to re-live the
fun and scare the newbies.  There were a few hundred tents set up in
the campsite by the evening, and the next morning I thought that I had
seen enough.  I go hiking to avoid crowds of that size, so I started
down the trail in the cool of the morning.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GHRj21tyVm8/Tdkx1FUfjMI/AAAAAAAABYY/zH2C1pKtysk/s800/DSCF0499.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GHRj21tyVm8/Tdkx1FUfjMI/AAAAAAAABYY/zH2C1pKtysk/s800/DSCF0499.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I was on my own for most of the day, but I met two couples that I
would later hike with for long distances: Raven and Lovebird, and
Funyan and Meow-Meow.  Of course, they didn&#39;t have their trail names
at that point, but after a while it becomes more natural to refer to
people by their trail names than their actual names.  At the end of
the day, I set up camp just above a dry creek bed with another person
with whom I would hike most of Southern California: a tall guy who got
the trail name Garby from his ability to clean everyone&#39;s plates
like a garbage disposal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The next day actually had some pine forest, which was a bit of a
surprise.  I enjoyed the shade, but it didn&#39;t last long, and
eventually I was back in the sun.  I ended the day in a campsite that
was the last bit of green on the map for many miles.  I had gotten
there minutes after Lovebird, Raven, and Garby.  There was another
person that I hadn&#39;t met before, who introduced himself as Swope.  I
told the group that my intention was to stay at the campsite so that I
could be sure to find a place to hang my hammock.  I very quickly
regretted it as Swope announced that that made us hiking buddies,
because he was staying there as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZRMjGMQuBCo/TdkzIapsZWI/AAAAAAAABaQ/tmmio8Ram0w/s800/DSCF0510.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZRMjGMQuBCo/TdkzIapsZWI/AAAAAAAABaQ/tmmio8Ram0w/s800/DSCF0510.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I could tell that Swope was a little off, and as the evening went on,
it became even more clear.  He talked a mile a minute about some very
strange topics, he clearly hadn&#39;t been long-distance hiking before,
and he had a massive pack (around 50 pounds) whose weight he had
reduced from about 80 pounds the day before.  He even had a satellite
phone with him &amp;ndash; pretty strange for someone who wanted to get away
from civilization.  Eventually, I had all that I could take and
escaped to my hammock for some shuteye.  (Sorry Swope if you ever read
this.  Some people are just not natural hiking companions.)  Swope got
out of camp ahead of me the next morning, but given his huge pack, I
had no trouble passing him very quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The hiking was turning out to be slightly different than I had
expected.  When I think of the desert, I imagine really sandy areas
with almost no vegetation.  This was fairly rocky with shrubs and
brushy trees.  Desert is actually a misnomer: the ecosystem is known
as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaparral&quot;&gt;chaparral&lt;/a&gt;.  It was still hot, though, and when I got to a water
tank at around noon, I decided to wait out the sun for a while.  While
I was waiting, I met Skinny D.  We talked for a while, and then she
went on ahead of me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Gj3_sGqRax4/Tdkzbwn54EI/AAAAAAAABaA/At4SK3R1Y5c/s800/DSCF0513.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Gj3_sGqRax4/Tdkzbwn54EI/AAAAAAAABaA/At4SK3R1Y5c/s800/DSCF0513.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We met again at Scissors Crossing &amp;ndash; an awkward intersection of roads
&amp;ndash; where trail angels had left water, energy drinks, beer, and even a
pie.  It was supper time, so we ate supper and then had the pie for
desert.  Skinny D went a bit farther, but I found some trees near a
dried creek bed, and hung out there.  It was surprisingly cold over
night &amp;ndash; the lack of moisture in the air causes that to happen &amp;ndash; and
I was glad to get moving the next morning so that I could get warm.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That day highlighted another big difference between the PCT and the
AT.  The whole day was spent going over one big hill.  On the AT, the
hills come thick and fast, but on the PCT they are much more gradual.
The net effect is that you spend a long time going up and then a long
time going down.  We finished the day just past mile 100, where I met
up with many of the people I had met earlier as well as two new ones:
Liz and Annie.  Annie had terrible blisters, but she was pushing
through the pain, which eventually led to her trail name &quot;Push&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It was only about 7 miles to the first trail town &amp;ndash; Warner Springs.
There&#39;s really not much more to the town than a small resort and a
gas-station convenience store, where I picked up my first resupply.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After getting to Warner Springs nice and early, I got a room at the
resort with Garby, and we had a lot of fun there with Raven and
Lovebird as well.  While we were eating at the pub, a
bedraggled-looking Swope walked in.  He was clearly the worse for
wear, and had only hiked as far as Scissors Crossing (meaning that he
had somehow gotten a day behind me despite starting at the same time
two days earlier).  He then hitchhiked to Warner Springs and was
intending to get a ride back to Scissors Crossing and return to Warner
Springs by running.  It was, as always, an unconventional approach.
It was the last I would see of him, but I did hear that he made it
farther than I had expected (though I don&#39;t know if he finished).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Later that night, the four of us went for a dip in the hot pool that
is fed by the hot springs.  It&#39;s debatable whether it hurt or helped
our hiking, but it was nice and relaxing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  There will be fewer characters to introduce, so hopefully I can
  write about more than one section.  The trail goes from chaparral to
  mountains and back, and we have a snow storm in the mountains and a
  rain storm in the desert.  Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to get to the part
  where I get massively lost by walking down the wrong mountain
  ridge.  That was fun.

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have written an account of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/./../AT&quot;&gt;AT hike&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I would
write down some things that I think are true about hiking before
writing about the next hike.  The first thing to note is that I
subscribe completely to the hike-your-own-hike (HYOH) philosophy, so
this should be read as descriptive more than prescriptive.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Leave No Trace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Okay, I lied.  This is the one prescription.  Read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lnt.org/programs/principles.php&quot;&gt;principles&lt;/a&gt;
  and follow them.  Also follow any other rules that are in place for
  the area that you&#39;re in.  If it says not to make camp fires, then
  don&#39;t.  It&#39;s a pity to need to say this, but I&#39;ve seen experienced
  hikers break the rules (and I&#39;m not perfect either, but I do my
  best).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  So much of the conversation about hiking with non-hikers or
  inexperienced hikers is about dangerous animals.  I probably saw
  less than one bear for every month of hiking that I did, and they
  were all running away from me.  I never hiked in grizzy country, and
  if I ever do, I&#39;ll think about maybe carrying bear spray, though I
  doubt I will in the end.  Wilderness is vast and bears and other
  dangerous animals are sparse.  They generally don&#39;t want anything to
  do with us.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The most scared I was of an animal on the AT was the time I saw a
  skunk on the trail in the Shenandoahs.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KQT9D0utAWY/TOXBZQbjviI/AAAAAAAAA4s/EEd3ZzaoEgs/s800/DSCF0277.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KQT9D0utAWY/TOXBZQbjviI/AAAAAAAAA4s/EEd3ZzaoEgs/s800/DSCF0277.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Gear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;m generally not an ultralighter, though I&#39;m moving more in that
  direction.  This is the gear that I used.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-1&quot;&gt;Shelter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   I love my hammock.  It&#39;s lighter than many tents, far more
   comfortable than sleeping on the ground, and you don&#39;t need to find
   a flat spot to set it up.  On the other hand, you do need to find
   suitable trees.  This is easy in a pine forest and is probably
   impossible in the plains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WYbtmOhGn-k/TOW_oCdtkCI/AAAAAAAAAfM/RN-5a_C5hK4/s400/DSCF0060.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WYbtmOhGn-k/TOW_oCdtkCI/AAAAAAAAAfM/RN-5a_C5hK4/s400/DSCF0060.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-2&quot;&gt;Shoes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   Not boots.  I grew to be very happy with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C0ZOEG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004C0ZOEG&quot;&gt;North Face Singletrack&lt;/a&gt;
   trail-running shoe.  It is a bit more rugged than a normal running
   shoe, but far less stiff and heavy than a boot.  I like my shoes to
   last at least 10 miles per dollar.  The Singletrack normally costs
   about $100 and lasts about 1000 miles, so that works out.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZuTaogQEfio/Tnu_74fePGI/AAAAAAAACbI/_rAU6IqEAQg/s640/DSCF0597.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZuTaogQEfio/Tnu_74fePGI/AAAAAAAACbI/_rAU6IqEAQg/s640/DSCF0597.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-3&quot;&gt;Pack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   I wore the same pack for both of my thru-hikes: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034NUZ8M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0034NUZ8M&quot;&gt;Black Diamond Infinity 60&lt;/a&gt;.  It worked well, though I came to feel that it was
   heavier than it needed to be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-4&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-4&quot;&gt;Clothes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-4&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   All synthetic.  For the AT hike, I wore the same shirt and shorts
   most of the way.  I got a new pair of shorts in Damascus, just
   because I was getting tired of the pair that I was wearing.  I
   started my AT hike with three pairs of socks and they lasted me the
   whole way.  I would generally change socks only as needed because
   they were wet or once per week during dry sections.  I carried the
   following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One short-sleeved shirt
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One long-sleeved shirt
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two pairs of underwear
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One pair of shorts
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One pair of long pants
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three pairs of socks
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One fleece
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One rain jacket
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One down jacket
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;     
   On sections that I knew would be very cold, I carried a hat and
   gloves.  In the Sierras I carried wool tights as well, and there
   were nights where I wore everything that I was carrying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-5&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-5&quot;&gt;Sleeping Bag&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-5&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   I have a fairly generic down sleeping bag from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mec.ca&quot;&gt;MEC&lt;/a&gt;.  Since it&#39;s
   down, I must be very careful to keep it dry.  To do this, I keep it
   in a trash bag inside its stuff sack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-6&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-6&quot;&gt;Bear canister&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-6&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   It&#39;s the law that you must carry one in the Sierras, so I did.
   They are the worst &amp;ndash; heavy and bulky, and they still don&#39;t fit as
   much food as a normal food bag.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-7&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-7&quot;&gt;Hiking poles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-7&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   As far as I can tell, simpler is better.  A strap is good and
   telescoping is good so that they fit in cars when hitching.  I&#39;ve
   never used poles with shock absorbers, but I really don&#39;t see how
   they would help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-8&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-8&quot;&gt;Cooking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-8&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   The main change between my hikes was my stove.  On my AT hike, I
   used a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P78F88/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004P78F88&quot;&gt;MSR Whisperlite&lt;/a&gt; stove.  It&#39;s a great stove &amp;ndash; it puts out
   varying levels of heat and is very fuel efficient &amp;ndash; but I thought
   it was a bit heavy for one person.  So on my PCT hike, I took a
   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003LDCVBY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=hikiandcodi-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003LDCVBY&quot;&gt;Vargo&lt;/a&gt; titanium alcohol stove.  It was lighter, but only had one
   temperature, was more prone to accidents, was a pain to fill, and
   required more fuel.  I know that if I was going on a hike with more
   than one person, I would take the Whisperlite, but I don&#39;t know
   what I&#39;d do on another solo hike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-9&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-9&quot;&gt;Maps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-9&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   For some hikes, they are necessary, for others emphatically not.  I
   took the &lt;a href=&quot;http://theatguide.com/&quot;&gt;AWOL guide&lt;/a&gt; on my AT hike and printed out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pctmap.net/&quot;&gt;Halfmile maps&lt;/a&gt;
   for my PCT hike.  Since the AT is so well marked, only an elevation
   profile is necessary so that you know how difficult the next
   stretch of trail will be.  On the other hand, it is important to
   have maps on the PCT because there are places where the trail is
   not obvious.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3-10&quot; class=&quot;outline-3&quot;&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sec-3-10&quot;&gt;Bear Line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-3&quot; id=&quot;text-3-10&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
   I have about 50 feet of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_cord&quot;&gt;parachute cord&lt;/a&gt; that I attach the lightest
   possible carabiner to.  I then use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgBLDMuPuvE&quot;&gt;PCT Method&lt;/a&gt; to hang the food
   bag from the tree (with varying degrees of success).  As I noted
   earlier, I&#39;m generally not too concerned about actual bears, but
   hanging food is always a good thing, especially near established
   campsites where there is a high probability of rodents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-4&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-4&quot;&gt;Packing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-4&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I&#39;m a firm believer that you should always pack in a consistent
  manner.  This saves you time rooting around in your pack.  The only
  tip that I have is that the sleeping bag should go on the bottom.
  You won&#39;t need it all day, and it&#39;s nice to have something soft on
  the bottom of your pack if you put it down quickly or fall down
  backwards.  Other than that, I don&#39;t think the order matters too
  much as long as it&#39;s consistent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-5&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-5&quot;&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-5&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Both of my long hikes have been solo hikes in the sense that I made
  no explicit arrangement with anyone else to hike together.  In both
  hikes, I have had periods of being truly alone and periods where I
  would regularly meet up with the same people nearly every night.  I
  probably enjoyed myself the most when I was in groups of three or
  four, but I also think that it would be nearly impossible for me to
  stay with one single group for an entire hike.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The community aspect of hiking is one of its strongest
  selling-points.  You meet all kinds of people who are all doing the
  same thing as you.  So that gives you something to talk about right
  away.  Nothing bonds like shared misery.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There is also a strong sense that everyone is looking out for each
  other.  This was put into the starkest relief for me when I was
  hiking in the Sierras on the PCT, so I&#39;ll go into it in more detail
  when I get around to writing about that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-6&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-6&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-6&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I might write another of these more general posts about hiking later.
  I still haven&#39;t touched on things like a daily schedule or what town
  stops are like.  For now, however, I think this post has gotten long
  enough.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered Georgia with one goal: get to Springer Mountain by my
birthday.  It&#39;s about 75 miles from the border to Springer, and I had
three and a half days, so I thought that I had a pretty good chance of
getting there on time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I needed to make one final stop in town before I got to the end for my
last resupply.  I got to the highway at about 5:00 and soon got a
hitch into Hiawassee.  67.5 miles to go.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-1&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Hiawassee to Springer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning, back on the trail with three days of food, I took
  an early break.  I went to put my pack on, and the buckle for the
  hip belt broke!  Some people with ultralight packs can hike without
  a hip belt, but I am not one of them (though I wish I was).  For
  me, the hip belt is the thing that bears most of the weight of the
  pack and the shoulder straps are more for stabilization.  In short,
  this almost rose to the level of an emergency.  Had it been earlier
  in the trip, or if I had not set a self-imposed deadline for the end
  of the hike, I might have turned around and hiked back to the road.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There was no way I was going to do that though.  I tried hiking
  without the hip belt for a little while, but it quickly became
  obvious that that wouldn&#39;t work.  It was time for some
  out-of-the-box thinking.  I seriously considered just leaving the
  pack behind and running the rest of the way to Springer.  I know
  that people run that far in less than 24 hours all the time, and
  considering the shape I was in, I probably could have done it.
  However, leaving all my stuff in the back woods of Georgia seemed
  like something to do only as a last resort, and spending a night
  without my pack would be too awful to risk.  Finally, I realized
  that I had my rope that I used to hang my bear bag.  I cut about a
  foot from that and tied the straps of my hip belt together.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Thankfully, it worked.  I soon got just as good at tying the hip
  belt together as I had been at buckling it.  It looked a little
  funny, like a person with a rope for a belt, but in the woods
  there&#39;s really no one to judge that sort of thing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The terrain was hilly that day, and between that and my hip-belt
  disaster, I didn&#39;t make it that far.  I ended up on the top of Rocky
  Mountain with 52.2 miles to go and two full days of hiking left.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Fortunately, the hills were less steep the next day, the weather was
  great, and I was on a roll.  With each mile that I got closer to the
  end of my journey, the better I felt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OBun7vrnzl4/TOXC8p5RC1I/AAAAAAAABPI/gWK7F1WvMdY/s800/DSCF0429.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-OBun7vrnzl4/TOXC8p5RC1I/AAAAAAAABPI/gWK7F1WvMdY/s800/DSCF0429.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Near the end of the day, I came to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Mountain&quot;&gt;Blood Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.  There is a
  shelter near the top, but it is 28.3 miles from Springer, so I kept
  on going.  I walked for about two more hours to get to a small
  campsite near a stream 22.3 miles from the finish line.  One day
  left, and within striking distance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The final day was much like the previous 131.  I got up early, had
  breakfast and walked.  I did see a small family of wild pigs in the
  morning, but it was otherwise a day pretty much like any other.  As
  I got closer to the end, my pace picked up, and I flew past some
  day-hikers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Springer Mountain is nothing compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/./../../posts/hiking/100-mile-wilderness&quot;&gt;Katahdin&lt;/a&gt;.  I am willing to
  stipulate that much.  Some will say that makes finishing a
  southbound AT hike anticlimactic, and that is one step too far for
  me.  I had walked nearly 2200 miles in the wilderness to get there;
  it was pretty damn climactic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vasthhIyDsw/TOXDBoTkJqI/AAAAAAAABQg/2XvPPR9mj_Q/s640/DSCF0437.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vasthhIyDsw/TOXDBoTkJqI/AAAAAAAABQg/2XvPPR9mj_Q/s640/DSCF0437.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I finished on my birthday, just as I had hoped.  It really was a
  great way to spend it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oucyoSno3wE/TOXDFWGUSkI/AAAAAAAABRc/yJsPJxobONY/s800/DSCF0450.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oucyoSno3wE/TOXDFWGUSkI/AAAAAAAABRc/yJsPJxobONY/s800/DSCF0450.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Coda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  The terminus of the trail is the top of a mountain.  There is no
  road up to there &amp;ndash; to get home you must take another trail.  I
  walked about a mile down that after finishing the AT, and camped one
  last time.  I was out of fuel, so I made my only campfire of the
  entire hike and made supper over that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I hiked out the next day past &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicalola_Falls&quot;&gt;Amicalola Falls&lt;/a&gt;.  At the end, there is
  a visitor&#39;s center, where I made sure to sign the final log book,
  and then I had to think about getting home.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hitching in a tourist area is never easy, so in the end I resorted
  to asking for rides from people who wanted to talk about my hike.  A
  nice older couple gave another hiker and me a ride into Atlanta, and
  just like that I was back in civilization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Next time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  That&#39;s it for the AT, but it&#39;s less than half of my long hikes.
  Depending on my mood, I might start right in on the PCT, or I might
  go a little deeper into the gear I used and other more general
  thoughts that I have about hiking.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Damascus to Erwin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I had a great time in Damascus with the little crew that I had met
  up with a few days earlier, but they wanted to stay in town a little
  longer than I did, so I went on without them.  The first day out of
  town, I had a certain shelter in mind to end at, but it got dark
  before I got there and, having no desire to night-hike, I simply
  stopped in the middle of a hill and set up my hammock.  I&#39;m fairly
  sure that was one of my most random campsites.  I didn&#39;t think it
  looked any good as a campsite, but I was tired and wanted to stop.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8fZ-ti3dcz4/TOXCLpKx74I/AAAAAAAABEs/hkBzRoF-np0/s800/DSCF0357.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8fZ-ti3dcz4/TOXCLpKx74I/AAAAAAAABEs/hkBzRoF-np0/s800/DSCF0357.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurel Fork Falls&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Maybe my thinking was skewed by the fact that I knew that if I could
  hike 25 miles per day for the next four days, I could stay at a
  hostel for each of them.   The first of these days took me to the
  Kincora hostel, home of Bob Peoples.  Bob is a trail maintainer in
  addition to being a hostel-keeper, and is a trail fixture.  Most of
  the graffiti in the shelters leading to his hostel consists of Chuck
  Norris-style jokes about him (all complimentary of course).  He has
  been running the hostel for over 20 years and still only charges $4
  per night.  While I was there, we sat and chatted a bit.  He told me
  about his previous hike in Europe and his plan for the next summer
  to work on the International AT in Canada, adding cairns so people
  can find their way in Newfoundland.  For an older guy (he must be
  nearly 70), he sure gets his kicks on the trail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-lBicNB2_kco/TOXCKDcoHUI/AAAAAAAABEY/rAERWP-mCKo/s800/DSCF0355.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-lBicNB2_kco/TOXCKDcoHUI/AAAAAAAABEY/rAERWP-mCKo/s800/DSCF0355.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The leaves by this point had all turned, and most of them were
  brown.  There were a few patches of color left, though.  For the
  most part, I was still in the &quot;tunnel&quot; of trees and branches, but
  the falling leaves gave some more opportunities to see outside it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WZ8VczQj33M/TOXCMx27zhI/AAAAAAAABFE/cLmrOJSzRwg/s800/DSCF0359.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WZ8VczQj33M/TOXCMx27zhI/AAAAAAAABFE/cLmrOJSzRwg/s800/DSCF0359.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next night I made it to the next hostel.  This was the Mountain
  Harbour Hostel.  They have a room above a barn that is really nice,
  but unfortunately it was booked by the time that I got there.  I did
  use it to shower in and watched City Slickers (a great trail movie
  by the way) before going to bed in an RV.  It was comfortable, but
  not as neat as the barn.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day started with a big climb up Hump Mountain.  It is the
  first of the &quot;balds&quot; that a southbound hiker hits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S1hfxMHYxhA/TOXCPGGVckI/AAAAAAAABFw/-xlAKwyqRBc/s800/DSCF0366.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-S1hfxMHYxhA/TOXCPGGVckI/AAAAAAAABFw/-xlAKwyqRBc/s800/DSCF0366.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As you can see, there are no trees &amp;ndash; it is just long grass.  After
  nearly 1800 miles of nearly consistent tree cover (and alpine
  terrain on the tops of mountains), this is a welcome change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xv4qN3hMZf0/TOXCQy1_0lI/AAAAAAAABGQ/Uu7uw2GRvfQ/s800/DSCF0370.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xv4qN3hMZf0/TOXCQy1_0lI/AAAAAAAABGQ/Uu7uw2GRvfQ/s800/DSCF0370.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Eventually the trail goes over 6000 feet elevation at Roan High
  Knob.  There is a shelter at the top, where I am sure it gets quite
  cold at night, but I wouldn&#39;t know because I wanted to get to the
  next hostel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next hostel was not a hostel but a &quot;friendly&quot; (get it?
  hostel&amp;hellip; hostile&amp;hellip; friendly (it&#39;s not a great joke)).  The
  proprietress, who was quirky but nice, wasn&#39;t there when I arrived,
  but she left a key so that I could get situated and watch a little
  TV.  She cooked me a great breakfast the next morning and I was on
  my way to the next one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The weather that day was rainy, and I got to use the rain jacket
  that I had purchased in Virginia for the first time.  Going up some
  rather high mountains in a thunderstorm wasn&#39;t so fun, but I was on
  a mission.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-18-yC2TThzA/TOXCUUsDYDI/AAAAAAAABHE/RlzjBWtuZEA/s800/DSCF0376.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-18-yC2TThzA/TOXCUUsDYDI/AAAAAAAABHE/RlzjBWtuZEA/s800/DSCF0376.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Luckily, the rain didn&#39;t last long, and soon it was a mere memory.
  I kept pushing on and made it to Erwin, TN by mid-afternoon.  The
  hostel in Erwin had a bunch of old guys just hanging around.  I
  might have found them amusing under other circumstances, but as it
  was I just found them (and Erwin by extension) a little sad.
  I got a resupply that evening and was out early the next morning.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;figure&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bNeMS0NsS-0/TOXCU1n69JI/AAAAAAAABHM/qHUwMddoRbQ/s800/DSCF0377.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-bNeMS0NsS-0/TOXCU1n69JI/AAAAAAAABHM/qHUwMddoRbQ/s800/DSCF0377.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Erwin to Gatlinburg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Out of Erwin, there is some significant climbing, and that combined
  with the threat of rain conspired to stop me after only 16 miles.
  I was glad to have stopped, because it did rain that evening and
  some the next morning as well.  Once again, the rain cleared up by
  the afternoon, and by the end of the day I was happy to be walking
  down the trail.  At the end of the day I came upon Hot Springs, NC.
  It was dark by the time I found the hostel that I had heard about.
  It is run by a Buddhist monk who makes gourmet vegetarian food.
  Naturally, I took a zero there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  By this time, I had done the math and determined that I could finish
  on my birthday if I kept a decent pace.  The zero set me back a
  little bit, so from then on I needed to really push: the only thing
  in my way was the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I met up with Skittles again the day after I left Hot Springs.  He
  had a bit of a falling-out with the rest of the group (as I
  understood it) and had hiked ahead of them.  It was nice to be
  around someone that I knew again, but we had such radically
  different paces during the day that we were never around each other
  for very long.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day ended just inside the national park at a shelter that
  had a chain-link fence enclosing it to keep the bears out.  There
  was a group there, and after a while it became clear to me that they
  were a church group.  Skittles showed up late and he never got the
  memo.  The next morning, he went with them to the top of a mountain
  off-trail (there were a couple of pretty young ladies in the group,
  and he thought he had a chance) and only found out then.  As he told
  me, he was pretty mad when he found out and spent a couple of hours
  arguing with them about the existence of God.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I, on the other hand, went to a shelter half a mile off the trail
  and spent the night alone at a mile high.  There were bear warnings
  all over, but I didn&#39;t see one.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oSiqXRADocw/TOXCfollvCI/AAAAAAAABJc/jmQjhW8uoE0/s800/DSCF0391.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-oSiqXRADocw/TOXCfollvCI/AAAAAAAABJc/jmQjhW8uoE0/s800/DSCF0391.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I love views where the mountains seem to be stacked one behind the
  other.  The Smokies had that in abundance, and the haze in these
  photos really shows where they got their name.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-USFWqkYdXng/TOXCgu51wWI/AAAAAAAABJ0/CkG9EF1uqOo/s800/DSCF0394.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-USFWqkYdXng/TOXCgu51wWI/AAAAAAAABJ0/CkG9EF1uqOo/s800/DSCF0394.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I was only about 10 miles from the road Gatlinburg, and got there
  easily by noon.  Despite the throngs of tourists, I wasn&#39;t able to
  get a hitch for over an hour (and even that was in the back of a
  pickup truck &amp;ndash; not fun for 15 miles at 60 miles per hour).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Gatlinburg is a strange place.  It&#39;s now overshadowed by Dollywood,
  but it was once the premier tourist destination in the area.  As
  such, it has everything you wouldn&#39;t expect: a Ripley&#39;s Believe it
  or Not, cable cars, a wax museum.  The only thing that isn&#39;t
  accessible in town is a grocery store.  I had to wait for a bus to
  take me out of town and back in order to resupply.  By the time I
  had gotten everything that I needed, it was getting pretty late, so
  I decided to stay in town.  The one advantage of it being such a
  touristy town is that there are many motels, and they&#39;re all pretty
  cheap.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-3&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-3&quot;&gt;Gatlinburg to the border&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I got picked up by a guy going back to the trail to do some trail
  maintenance the next day.  Soon after getting dropped off, I hit the
  highest point on the trail &amp;ndash; Clingman&#39;s Dome.  For some reason
  unknown to man, there is a completely ugly structure on top.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DoWWt_id7ug/TOXCqBMQf_I/AAAAAAAABLU/C2ebU9qnbQQ/s800/DSCF0404.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DoWWt_id7ug/TOXCqBMQf_I/AAAAAAAABLU/C2ebU9qnbQQ/s800/DSCF0404.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The hike was all relatively downhill from there&lt;a href=&quot;http://instantrimshot.com/&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;  The next morning
  it snowed for the first time on the hike.  At first, this seemed
  exciting and fun, but it really was just a colder version of rain.
  I stayed at a shelter called the &quot;Fontana Hilton&quot; that night, so
  called because it&#39;s a large shelter near the Fontana Dam.  It&#39;s
  nowhere near as comfortable as a Hilton hotel, though, and it was
  packed for the night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next day was even snowier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-q0DG66O-4Fw/TOXCvSy-B6I/AAAAAAAABMg/dd4ADNAEevY/s800/DSCF0411.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-q0DG66O-4Fw/TOXCvSy-B6I/AAAAAAAABMg/dd4ADNAEevY/s800/DSCF0411.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The snow didn&#39;t slow me down too much, because I was on a mission to
  get to the Nantahala Outdoor Center.  I hit a shelter full of people
  at about 5 pm with about 7 miles left to go before I got there.  I
  didn&#39;t even hesitate about staying at the shelter.  I knew that if I
  was going to make it to the end by my birthday, I would have to do
  the miles that night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I eventually did make it to the outdoor center, after a little bit
  of night-hiking.  I am almost always against the idea of
  night-hiking, but it really is magical in the snow: everywhere that
  your headlamp hits just sparkles.  I was really glad to be inside
  that night &amp;ndash; it snowed more and got quite cold outside and I was
  snug inside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next morning was still cold, so I went and bought a cap at the
  outfitter.  It was a good thing that I did too, because I was cold
  almost all of that day.  That night it got the coldest that it ever
  was on the trail.  My sleeping bag, rated at 0 C (meaning that
  I should be comfortable all the way down to that temperature) was
  really not warm enough.  I slept in all my clothes and had just my
  nose poking out the top.  It was cold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Thankfully, that was the coldest night that I spent on the trail.
  The sun came out the next day and never went away again.  I passed
  the point where I only had 100 miles left and at that point I was
  pretty certain that I would make it.  I had 4 days left until my
  birthday, and I was also pretty certain that I would make it by
  then.  Thinking back to the beginning of my hike, that would have
  been hubris, but now that I had gotten near the end, it really was
  justified confidence.  That said, there were some tests to come, but
  no more in North Carolina, because I was almost out of there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Acn7auhOXgQ/TOXC3T_cAcI/AAAAAAAABN4/k6GNwAfjk-s/s800/DSCF0419.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Acn7auhOXgQ/TOXC3T_cAcI/AAAAAAAABN4/k6GNwAfjk-s/s800/DSCF0419.JPG&quot; /&gt;

  Georgia.  The last state on the trail, containing the final
  challenge for my hike.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Waynesboro to Daleville&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  In my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com//tags/hiking/./../../posts/hiking/north-va&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned what a hard time I had in the
  Shenandoah National Park because of the rain.  In Waynesboro, I
  decided to do something about that.  I mailed my rain jacket home
  and went to an outfitters to get a new one.  I got a nice compact
  down jacket while I was at it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  There is a diner in town that has all-you-can-eat pancakes, so
  breakfast and lunch were taken care of.  I couldn&#39;t walk very fast
  with so much food in my stomach, though, so I didn&#39;t go far past
  Waynesboro.  At the shelter, I met Farm-a-sea, whose trail name had
  a double meaning.  He was training to become a fish farmer when he
  wasn&#39;t hiking, and he also had a sizable cache of medicinal herbs.
  He was an interesting guy though.  He would pack a dozen eggs and a
  large hunk of bacon out of town.  He had a skillet for frying them
  in, and would build a fire at every shelter and cook his supper in
  the skillet.  Really old-school stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The terrain in Virginia became hilly once again.  After the flatness
  of Pennsylvania, this took some getting used to.  Also, since
  Southern Pennsylvania, the leaves had been falling, and by Central
  Virginia, they were falling in earnest.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/---71aZGG9Pw/TOXBaqs19sI/AAAAAAAAA5A/yMiEIbVmITA/s800/DSCF0279.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/---71aZGG9Pw/TOXBaqs19sI/AAAAAAAAA5A/yMiEIbVmITA/s800/DSCF0279.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  It was in this section that I realized that I had not packed enough
  food for the number of days that I would need if I was going to
  continue at the same average speed.  Thus, I needed to pick up my
  average mileage considerably.  I did two 30-mile days and two
  25-mile days into Daleville.  There was some interesting scenery on
  the way, including this rock formation, rather ominously named &quot;The
  Guillotine&quot;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5QG7ZkAwCsw/TOXBkYjN3vI/AAAAAAAAA7w/ToGxgOOKRSo/s800/DSCF0298.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5QG7ZkAwCsw/TOXBkYjN3vI/AAAAAAAAA7w/ToGxgOOKRSo/s800/DSCF0298.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  By the time I got to Daleville, I was in a pretty serious calorie
  deficit.  I went and had a big supper at a crappy Mexican
  restaurant, followed by two beers from the store in my motel room.
  I could tell midway through the second beer that it wasn&#39;t a good
  idea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Daleville to Damascus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I was hung over all the next day.  However, following my experience
  from the previous week, I tried to make miles and not allow it to
  slow me down.  I didn&#39;t want to be stuck without food once again.
  Hiking with a hangover is really terrible, though, and it seemed
  like every 10 minutes I needed to sit down or bend over and try to
  vomit.  I didn&#39;t get anything out all day, but I didn&#39;t eat anything
  either, so by the end of the day I was getting hungry.  I took this
  as a good sign and ate some Teriyaki Noodles.  I couldn&#39;t keep them
  down through the night, but after I had gone into the woods to
  deposit them on the ground, I finally felt better.  However, the
  memory of that day has been enough to keep me from drinking alcohol
  ever since.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  
  The next days were better, though marred by bad trail maintenance
  and ragweed.  One highlight was the second-largest oak tree on the
  trail:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The day after that picture was taken, I ended up at The Captain&#39;s
  place, a small hostel with tenting in the yard.  The really
  interesting feature of it was that you needed to take a cable car
  across the creek to get there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The following day, I ended up at Pearisburg.  It is another
  spread-out town, and I had to walk a couple of miles to get to the
  store.  However, I had had a sleeping bag sent there because mine
  had been leaking feathers for quite a while, and I was able to pick
  it up, so that was nice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I went to the Woods Hole hostel the next day, which was a greatly
  relaxing day.  One of the hostel-keepers teaches yoga and the other
  is a masseur (though the massages weren&#39;t free, and I didn&#39;t feel
  like getting one).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-as7GEIfL9gY/TOXB5mbZT9I/AAAAAAAABA0/VeqESiZRKfc/s800/DSCF0332.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-as7GEIfL9gY/TOXB5mbZT9I/AAAAAAAABA0/VeqESiZRKfc/s800/DSCF0332.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  After Woods Hole, I really started rolling.  I did a 20-mile day the
  next day and a 34-mile day the day after that.  This took me to the
  Chestnut Knob shelter, which is a completely enclosed shelter on the
  top of a mountain.  It was windy all night, but I slept fairly
  comfortably after my long day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next two days weren&#39;t too special.  I stayed in a motel near the
  interstate and a shelter that was reportedly haunted (though I saw
  no evidence of a haunting).  The day after that, though I entered
  the Grayson Highlands State Park.  This is a park that is famous for
  the wild ponies that roam it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Pi9paLjIp4w/TOXCC-zwgTI/AAAAAAAABCw/2s80vuVgMmk/s800/DSCF0345.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Pi9paLjIp4w/TOXCC-zwgTI/AAAAAAAABCw/2s80vuVgMmk/s800/DSCF0345.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I got a picture with me near them that shows how small they really
  are.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-W6OOfZuUnlM/TOXCD941S_I/AAAAAAAABDE/I7ZbXLwWgY4/s800/DSCF0347.JPG&quot;  alt=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-W6OOfZuUnlM/TOXCD941S_I/AAAAAAAABDE/I7ZbXLwWgY4/s800/DSCF0347.JPG&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I had heard that they will come up to you and lick or chew your pack
  in order to get the salt from your sweat, but that didn&#39;t happen to
  me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Just before I got to the Grayson Highlands, I met up with another
  group of hikers: Skittles, Flora, Abear, and Coyote.  I had been
  following most of them in the shelter logs for months, so it was
  like meeting old friends.  Flora in particular signed her name with
  a large flower (her hiking partner Fauna had left near Washington,
  DC), so her entries were hard to miss.  We hiked together off and on
  for a few days, and it was nice to be hiking with people once again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  We all stopped together in Damascus, VA and found cheap
  accommodation in a building run by a local church.  It was empty,
  but it had strict rules (no cooking in the rooms was the one they
  seemed most concerned with) and a person came during the night to
  make sure that we were following them.  I found a new pair of shoes
  on sale in Damascus, so I got them and got rid of my previous pair
  which were falling apart.  They had only lasted about 500 miles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I left Damascus early the next day, leaving the group behind.
  Skittles would catch up with me and we would hike together a bit
  longer, but I didn&#39;t see the rest again.  Just past Damascus, I left
  Virginia for Tennessee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-3&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  Tennessee and North Carolina.  A run of four straight hostels, and
  the weather finally turning cold.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
