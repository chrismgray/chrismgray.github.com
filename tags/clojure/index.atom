&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;More about rationals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  While attempting to implement &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrismgray.github.com/posts/rationals-in-cljs/&quot;&gt;support for rationals&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, I
  stumbled on what is (or at least, seems to me to be) a bug in the
  Clojure compiler itself.  That is, one can not refer to the function
  &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; in namespaces other than &lt;code&gt;clojure.core&lt;/code&gt;.  Now, this is probably
  the first time that anyone has wanted to do this, so it&#39;s not
  surprising that no one had seen the bug before.  But what was
  surprising to me was that I could fix it fairly easily.  I submitted
  my patch, and I should be a real-life contributor to Clojure pretty
  soon.  As a person who doesn&#39;t see himself as a compiler guy, that&#39;s
  pretty exciting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  The next problem that I&#39;m having is that redefining the basic
  arithmetic operations does not seem to work properly in
  Clojurescript.  The compiled javascript is trying (at least as far
  as I can tell) to redefine &lt;code&gt;cljs.core/+&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;rationals/+&lt;/code&gt;,
  for example.  This is the problem that I am going to try to solve
  today.  
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  My previous post said that I would be using the macros defined in
  Clojurescript&#39;s &lt;code&gt;core.clj&lt;/code&gt;.  It turns out that doesn&#39;t make a lot of
  sense.  I am using the functions defined in &lt;code&gt;core.cljs&lt;/code&gt; instead.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-1&quot;&gt;Rationals in Clojurescript &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-1&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Last night, I uploaded some code to compute the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram&quot;&gt;Voronoi Diagram&lt;/a&gt; of a
set of points to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chrismgray/voronoi-diagram/&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.  This post is not directly about that code --
I&#39;ll write about that when it is completely working &amp;ndash; but rather
about something that I noticed when I tried to convert the code to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript&quot;&gt;Clojurescript&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are a few things that are known not to work in Clojurescript
that work in Clojure: I had to convert calls from &lt;code&gt;lazy-cat&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, for example.  However, the one difference that really broke
things for me was the lack of support for rational arithmetic in
Clojurescript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One major element of my algorithm is a test to determine whether a
given point is on a given line segment.  With integer coordinates for
the sites that determine the Voronoi Diagram and the bounding box,
everything about this test can be represented as a rational number.
Since Clojure gives you rational numbers by default, while
Clojurescript simply uses Javascript&#39;s arithmetic facilities, the test
works in Clojure but not in Clojurescript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what can be done about this?  Here are some options:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;sec-1-1&quot;&gt;Use floats, but more smartly &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     Probably the simplest option, here we would not test for &lt;i&gt;equality&lt;/i&gt;,
     but for &lt;i&gt;almost equality&lt;/i&gt;.  That is, if the distance between two
     points is a very small number (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt; a millionth), and all of the
     input is integer, then the two points are probably the same.  This
     option is obviously not too satisfying from a theoretical
     standpoint, especially if the small number is hardcoded.  I am
     fairly sure that there has been research to determine what the exact
     value of the small number should be, but that would take the code
     out of the realm of simplicity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;sec-1-2&quot;&gt;Implement rationals in Clojurescript &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     I am not sure how possible this option is.  However, it is currently
     the most appealing to me.  Rational arithmetic is not so difficult
     to implement, especially in the limited use case that I need it for:
     I am pretty sure that I could get away with &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, and
     the comparison operators.  These are currently implemented as
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/3c83c62d973b0153a9e28bea7beb73794fbf9065/src/clj/cljs/core.clj#L51&quot;&gt;macros&lt;/a&gt; in Clojurescript, which means that they take the
     Clojurescript code and change it Javascript code.  This allows
     the Clojurescript compiler to take the prefix syntax of
     Clojurescript and change it to the infix syntax of Javascript.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     If we were to redefine the operators to be functions, we might
     have a chance to run different code given different types of
     input.  The &lt;code&gt;defmulti&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;defmethod&lt;/code&gt; macros seem perfect for
     this.  The major question is whether it is possible to shadow the
     names of the operators but use them nevertheless.  That is, will
     I be able to add &lt;code&gt;(:require-macros [clojure.core :as core])&lt;/code&gt; to
     my namespace and then use, for example, &lt;code&gt;core/*&lt;/code&gt;?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     The other downside, beyond the potential difficulties, is the
     fact that the generated Javascript will no longer be quite as
     pretty.  What used to be infix notation will be converted to
     function calls.  Additionally, there will be a fairly high
     penalty for doing arithmetic &amp;ndash; three or four function calls per
     arithmetic operation (assuming the polymorphic solution I have in
     mind works) rather than the current single operation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;outline-container-2&quot; class=&quot;outline-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;sec-2&quot;&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;outline-text-2&quot; id=&quot;text-2&quot;&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  I am going to try to implement the rationals in Clojurescript
  first.  At the very least, I will learn a bit more about how
  multimethods work in Clojure. 
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
