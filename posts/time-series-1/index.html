<h2 id="sec-1">Programming challenges</h2>

<p>
  One of the interesting aspects of looking for a job this time around
  is that most of the companies that I have applied at have asked me
  to do a programming challenge as a kind of weed-out step.  It has
  been fun and a good way of keeping in practice.  In fact, I have
  resolved to learn at least one new feature of the programming
  language that I am using for each one.

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Time series framework</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  My latest programming challenge is to build a framework for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">time series</a> generation.  The framework will take a function $f$ that
  looks at the $n$ previous timesteps and returns the next timestep.
  The other goals are:
</p><ul>
<li>Efficiency

<p>    
    Adding a new timestep should be a $O(1)$ operation.
</p></li>
<li>Ease of debugging

<p>    
    If an error occurs in computing the next timestep, the stack trace
    should be easily comprehensible and show the current state of the
    time series.
</p></li>
<li>Traceability

<p>    
    It should be possible to see the differences between two different
    functions.  
</p></li>
</ul>

  This seems like the perfect time to learn about <a href="http://onclojure.com/2009/03/05/a-monad-tutorial-for-clojure-programmers-part-1/">monads</a>.  Yikes!
  I've tried before, but have never seen a practical use for them.  As
  far as I understand so far, they should be very good for storing the
  state (<i>i.e.</i> the previous $n$ timesteps).
</p>
<p>
  A simpler solution might be just to use lazy sequences.  There's not
  much to such a solution, so I might just implement it first and then
  try to replicate it with monads.  In this solution, the previous $n$
  timesteps are simply the last $n$ elements of the lazy sequence.
  Getting those elements might be tough to do in constant time, but I
  have a feeling it's possible.
</p>
<p>
  On the debugging front, there shouldn't be too much complexity: it
  should just be a combination of <code>try</code>, <code>catch</code>, and <code>throw</code>.
  There's also <code>clojure.stacktrace</code> if I want to get even fancier.
</p>
<p>
  As far as tracing goes, I might have a look at <code>tools.trace</code> to see
  if there's anything interesting there that I can use.  I think that
  monads might provide another way of doing the same thing.  We'll see
  which is simpler.  It might also be nice to use <a href="http://incanter.org">incanter</a> to display
  the differences between two (or more) different functions.
</p>
<p>
  On to the coding!
