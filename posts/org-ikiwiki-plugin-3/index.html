<div id="content">

<p>Writing my <a href="./../org-ikiwiki-plugin">new plugin</a> in Emacs Lisp, I learned a few things.  Here are
some of them, in no particular order.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">xml-rpc.el has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  I don't mean to be unkind here.  xml-rpc.el seems pretty good if you
  are doing exactly one kind of thing: calling a method on a server
  that can be reached by http.  For anything else, it is very hard to
  use.   My plugin has the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be called by another program through xml-rpc.
</li>
<li>It must read from and write to files (and not http).
</li>
</ul>


<p>    
  Neither of these things is made easy with xml-rpc.  The first I can
  understand &ndash; xml-rpc would have to somehow insinuate itself into
  the emacs event loop and watch for calls all the time.  The second
  is less easy to understand.  Parsing xml-rpc is not really related
  to reading from http.  So why are the two things tied together?  In
  my opinion, xml-rpc.el would be a much nicer library if parsing the
  xml-rpc was separated completely from the http stuff.  There could
  be convenience functions, but they would be a layer of abstraction
  on top of the other two layers.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">xml.el has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  There isn't a function to get a list of all nodes with a given name?
  Are you kidding me?  Here is my implementation, but I bet there is a
  better one somewhere:
</p>



<pre class="src src-elisp">(<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">defun</span> <span style="color: #8cd0d3;">xml-find-nodes-matching</span> (node name)
  <span style="color: #8fb28f;">"Returns all children of `</span><span style="color: #dca3a3; font-weight: bold;">node</span><span style="color: #8fb28f;">' that have an `</span><span style="color: #dca3a3; font-weight: bold;">xml-node-name</span><span style="color: #8fb28f;">' equal to `</span><span style="color: #dca3a3; font-weight: bold;">name</span><span style="color: #8fb28f;">'."</span>
  (<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">if</span> (or (eq node '()) (not (listp node)))
      '()
    (<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">if</span> (equal (xml-node-name node) name)
        (cons node (delq nil (mapcar (<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">lambda</span> (nd) (xml-find-nodes-matching nd name)) (xml-node-children node))))
      (delq nil (apply 'append (mapcar (<span style="color: #f0dfaf; font-weight: bold;">lambda</span> (nd) (xml-find-nodes-matching nd name)) (xml-node-children node)))))))
</pre>




<p>
  In general, both xml-rpc.el and xml.el use a distressing number of
  calls to <code>car</code>, <code>cdr</code>, and <code>cdaddr</code> (and all the versions in
  between).  
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Perl has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  Ikiwiki sends named parameters as an even-lengthed xml-rpc array
  rather than as an xml-rpc struct.  This is because not all of the
  functions that can be called via xml-rpc take named parameters and I
  guess Perl isn't smart enough to tell a hash from an even-lengthed
  array.  This isn't a huge problem, but it does mean that I need to
  convert the input to each of the functions that I write into a hash
  before I use it.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Ikiwiki has some problems </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
  I would like to be able to ignore files that don't have a particular
  extension.  For <code>htmlify</code>, this is the way it works by default.  It
  seems like most of the functions that plugins can implement are not
  this way by default, though, and that is a shame.  If the plugin is
  not external &ndash; that is, it is written in Perl &ndash; there is really no
  problem.  The function is called, checks the extension of the source
  file, and returns without doing anything.  However, when the plugin
  is external and the call must happen through xml-rpc, ikiwiki must
  transmit the data via xml-rpc and receive the returned data back via
  xml-rpc.  Unnecessary calls take a lot longer in that context.
</p>
<p>
  So I would like for most calls to <code>hook</code> to take an optional
  <code>extension</code> parameter that takes an extension (or even better, a
  regexp), and only call the function if the file name has the same
  extension (or matches the regexp).
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Working with emacs buffers is pretty nice </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
  Does a function that you're trying to write in emacs lisp give you a
  string?  It's pretty easy to throw it in a temporary buffer and then
  tell emacs to do the things that you would normally do while you
  were editing in order to get the proper information out of the
  string.  The <code>with-temporary-buffer</code> macro makes it especially easy
  to do just that.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6">Getting info from a structured list is easier to do as a recursive function </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
  One of the things that took me the longest was to figure out what
  this couple of lines of code was doing:
</p>



<pre class="src src-elisp">(setq valtype (car (caddar xml-list))
      valvalue (caddr (caddar xml-list)))  
</pre>




<p>
  What should the value of <code>xml-list</code> look like in order to get the
  correct thing out of it?  It turned out that I needed to take the
  <code>cdr</code> of the <code>cdaddr</code> of the <code>caddar</code> of the parsed xml in order to
  get the correct value.  That only worked when ikiwiki was responding
  to a method call, though.  I had a much easier time getting the
  right values out when I simply started using the
  <code>xml-find-nodes-matching</code> function that I showed above.
</p>
<p>
  When you see yourself writing more than a few <code>car</code> or <code>cdr</code> calls
  in a row (or <code>first</code>, <code>rest</code>, or <code>nth</code> calls in Clojure), stop and
  try to write a function that finds what you are looking for.  The
  function doesn't have to be recursive, but that might be the easiest
  way to do it.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7">It's nice when all calls and responses are dumped to a file </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">


<p>
  In a sense, this is just saying that code can be easier to debug if
  you're tracing it.  But since the calls between ikiwiki and the
  plugin must go through files anyway, we get the program traced
  automatically.
