<h2 id="sec-1">More fun with emacs </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  Lately, I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Anything">anything.el</a>, which has been
  described as "Quicksilver for emacs".  I've played around with it
  before, but have had a hard time changing my habits so that it's the
  first thing I think of doing when changing buffers or finding
  files.  The main reason, I think, is that <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IswitchBuffers">iswitch</a> is usually just as
  fast.
</p>
<p>
  However, I have started using <a href="./../git-annex">git annex</a> to store my music and
  videos, and that has added some complexity to the way that I deal
  with them.  My usual flow is to do a <code>git annex find</code> to see what
  files I have on my laptop, after which I play one of them with
  <code>smplayer</code>.  When I am done with the file, I either use <code>git annex   drop</code> or <code>git annex move</code> to get rid of the file from my laptop.
</p>
<p>
  All of that takes a lot of typing in the shell, so I wondered
  whether I could speed it up using <code>anything</code>.  If you guessed that I
  could (given that I am writing this article), give yourself a gold
  star.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">How I did it </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  <code>anything</code> is highly extensible.  Anyone can define their own setup
  with a command like this:
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun my-anything ()
  (interactive)
  (anything-other-buffer
   '(anything-c-source-buffers+
     anything-c-source-recentf
     anything-c-source-files-in-current-dir+
     anything-c-source-git-annex
     anything-c-source-org-headline
     anything-c-source-bookmarks
     anything-c-source-bookmark-set
     anything-c-source-emms-files)
    "*anything*"))
</pre>




<p>
  which is just a function that tells <code>anything</code> to use a bunch of
  different "sources" as possible interesting things that you might
  want to interact with.  For example, <code>anything-c-source-recentf</code>
  gives a list of files that you recently had open.  That comes with
  the <code>anything</code> package, though, so it's not too interesting from our
  point of view.  What is interesting is
  <code>anything-c-source-git-annex</code>.  It looks like this:
</p>



<pre class="example">(defvar anything-c-source-git-annex
  '((name . "Git Annex")
    (candidates . (lambda ()
                    (with-current-buffer anything-current-buffer
                     (with-temp-buffer
                       (call-process "git" nil t nil "annex" "find")
                       (goto-char (point-min))
                       (split-string (buffer-string) "\n")))))
    (volatile)
    (action . (("Watch" . anything-c-git-annex-play)
               ("Drop" . anything-c-git-annex-drop)
               ("Move" . anything-c-git-annex-move)
               ("Copy" . anything-c-git-annex-copy)))))
</pre>




<p>
  It should hopefully be fairly easy to understand.  There are two
  interesting parts: getting candidate files, and the actions on the
  candidate files.  Getting the candidate files is as simple as
  putting the results of <code>git annex find</code> into a temporary buffer
  (which must be in the same directory as the current buffer) and then
  putting the lines of the buffer into a list.  (This wouldn't work if
  the file names contained newlines, but I don't have any of those.
  If you wanted to be really careful, you could add the "&ndash;print0"
  option to <code>call-process</code> and split the string on "\0".)
</p>
<p>
  The actions are all functions.  The simplest is
  <code>anything-c-git-annex-drop</code>, which just looks like
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun anything-c-git-annex-drop (candidate)
  (anything-git-annex-command "drop" (concat "\"" candidate "\"")))
</pre>




<p>
  where <code>anything-git-annex-command</code> just starts a shell command.
  More interesting is <code>anything-c-git-annex-copy</code>, which is defined as
  follows
</p>



<pre class="example">(defun anything-c-git-annex-copy (candidate)
  (let* ((to (anything-comp-read
              "To Git Annex: "
              (anything-c-git-remotes)
              :must-match nil)))
    (anything-git-annex-command "copy" (concat "\"" candidate "\"")
                                "--to" (concat "\"" to "\""))))

(defun anything-c-git-remotes ()
  (with-temp-buffer
    (call-process "git" nil (current-buffer) nil "remote")
    (delete "" (split-string (buffer-string) "\n"))))
</pre>




<p>
  The <code>anything-c-git-annex-copy</code> command needs to know to which
  repository it should copy the candidate that has been selected.  I
  find out which one I want to copy to by listing the remotes that are
  known about by the git repository that the file is in.  Using
  <code>anything-comp-read</code> means that the remotes are listed in the same
  style all of the <code>anything</code> candidates are listed in.  It's pretty
  nice, because it keeps me in the same mode of operation as before.

<p>
  It's a bit hard to write about what makes <code>anything.el</code> an
  interesting way of doing things in emacs &ndash; a screencast might be
  more helpful &ndash; but I hope some of the power is evident from this
  little writeup.  I'm going to try to train myself to use <code>anything</code>
  more often.  We'll see how it goes.
