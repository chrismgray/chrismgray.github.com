  Well, yesterday was either a very productive day or a very lucky day
  for me.  I read up on monads &ndash; I found that <a href="http://onclojure.com/2009/03/05/a-monad-tutorial-for-clojure-programmers-part-1/">khinsen's tutorials</a> and
  <a href="http://intensivesystems.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tutorials/monads_101.html">Jim Duey's tutorials</a> complemented each other nicely.  Then I went
  for a long run (about 18 miles I think) and let the ideas sink in.
  When I got home, I found <code>state-m</code> and <code>m-seq</code> and the job was
  almost done.
</p>
<p>
  Just as a reminder, <a href="http://chrismgray.github.com/posts/time-series-1">yesterday's task</a> was to build a time-series
  framework where a function \(f\) accepts the previous \(n\) outputs of
  \(f\) as input to generate a new output.  Here is my solution, edited
  for clarity (the actual solution is in a <a href="http://github.com/chrismgray/time-series">github repository</a>):
</p>



<pre class="example">(defn time-series [f init-state n num-iterations]
 (let [call-f (fn [state]
                (let [retval (f state)
                      num (count state)
                      new-state (vec (if (= num n) (drop 1 (conj state retval)) (conj state retval)))]
                  [retval new-state]))]
   ((with-monad state-m
      (m-seq (repeat num-iterations call-f)))
    (vector init-state))))
</pre>




<p>
  As you can see, the heavy lifting is done by the <code>state</code> monad and
  by <code>m-seq</code>.  What do they do?  Well, <code>m-seq</code> can be thought of as
  taking a list of functions and calling them in order, returning a
  list of their return values.  The list of functions in this case is
  the same function (<code>call-f</code>) over and over.  All <code>call-f</code> does is
  call \(f\) and change the state.
</p>
<p>
  It might appear that <code>call-f</code> is an \(O(n)\) function.  After all, we
  call <code>count</code> on the state, which is a vector of at most \(n\)
  elements.  However, almost all the behind-the-scenes data structures
  that Clojure uses (including the vector data structure) are
  guaranteed to have \(O(1)\) performance for calling <code>count</code>.  So
  that's nice, and <code>call-f</code> has the performance characteristics that I
  desired.

<p>
  They're still a slightly confusing and magical-seeming thing to me,
  but monads have some obvious utility.  I guess the way to think
  about them is that if you put your input and output in a common
  format, then they aid you in stringing functions together very
  easily.  I used them in this case to encapsulate state, and that is
  probably the most common use of them in Clojure (judging by the
  number of state functions in the Clojure monads library).  However,
  I think I should probably try to understand all the monads in the
  library and know how to combine them.
</p>
<p>
  I could have written the function above without monads, but the code
  would not have been nearly as concise, and there probably would have
  been many more edge-cases to consider.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  I also wrote some stuff to make debugging easier, and used incanter
  to compare multiple time series.  However, neither required me to
  bend my brain as much as monads, so I won't talk about them very
  much.  In fact, not at all, because that is the end of my post.
