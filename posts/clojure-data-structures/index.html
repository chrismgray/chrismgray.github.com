<div id="content">

<p>This past week, I've been knee-deep in Clojure data structures --
mostly persistent vector and hash-map.  The goal has been to provide
replacements written in pure Clojure that can be ported to
ClojureScript, but it has also been a great way to learn about how
these structures work.  So in this post, I'll try to summarize what I
learned, and give some the results of my hacking.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Vector</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  I started this project inspired by a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/swannodette">David Nolen</a>.  I can't
  find it any more, but he mentioned that he had ported the
  persistent-vector data structure to JavaScript and that he was
  hoping to use it in ClojureScript.  That made me think: since
  the ClojureScript compiler now supports languages other than
  JavaScript as its backends, wouldn't it be helpful, at least for
  those backends, to port the data structure to pure Clojure, so that
  any ClojureScript backend could use it?
</p>
<p>
  So I did.  The result is <a href="https://github.com/chrismgray/persistent-data-structures/blob/master/src/persistent_data_structures/vector.clj">here</a>.  Instead of merely mechanically
  porting the Java into Clojure, I tried to really understand what was
  going on.  The gist is really simple (and has been talked about
  before): the vector is actually a tree with branching-factor 32, and
  a buffer of size 32.  When you add to the vector, you really add to
  the buffer if you can, copying the buffer before writing to it.
  When the buffer fills up, it is put in the tree, and again nodes are
  copied rather than simply written-to.
</p>
<p>
  This procedure means that adding an element is a \(O(\log n)\)
  operation, but the constants are really good: for one thing, the
  base of the \(\log\) is 32, so the influence of the \(\log n\) in
  the overall running time is pretty small even for very large \(n\).
  For another thing, the \(\log n\) penalty is only incurred on every
  thirty-second insert.  Most inserts are constant-time.
</p>
<p>
  Another cool feature is the way that the tree is structured.  Each
  node has its children in an array of length 32.  This means that the
  subtree that contains a given element can be found very quickly by
  simple bit operations.  To find the subtree containing element \(i\)
  in tree level \(k\), you shift \(i\) to the right by \(5k\) places
  and take the rightmost 5 bits.  This procedure would work with
  arrays that are of length of any power of 2, where you replace 5 by
  the \(\log_2\) of the length.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, László Török had pretty much the same idea as I did (and the
  author of gvec.clj, which is in the core distribution, had the same
  idea before either of us), and his code was better-tuned than mine,
  so it is what went into the new release of ClojureScript.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-1">An aside</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">


<p>
   When vectors are created in Clojure (but not yet in ClojureScript),
   they are created by way of a transient vector.  The idea behind this
   is that the transient vector is only around for the creation of the
   vector, so it does not need to be persistent.  Thus, it does not
   need to use the copy-on-write policy that persistent vectors use.
   In order to build a larger vector, it simply adds to an empty vector
   using the same procedure that I outlined above.
</p>
<p>
   Theoretically at least, that is not the optimal algorithm.  The
   trees can be built from the bottom-up (much like <a href="./../clojure-sorting">heaps</a>), giving a
   \(O(n)\) algorithm, which also has very good constants.  I haven't
   computed the constant, but it should be less than \(1 {1 \over
   16}\).  I implemented this algorithm in Clojure, but the difference
   in constants between Clojure code and pure Java code, and the fact
   that the constants in the Java implementation are <b>so</b> low meant
   that my implementation was slower even for very large \(n\).  I may
   one day try to port my bottom-up algorithm back to Java, but I kind
   of doubt it would make much difference.  Sometimes the
   theoretically better solution just isn't better in the real world.

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Hash Maps</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  I also had a look at hash maps.  The basic idea behind any hash-map
  is to store a key-value pair by first computing the <i>hash</i> of the
  key to something much smaller &ndash; in Clojure's case a 32-bit integer
  &ndash; and then storing the pair in a location based on that hash.
  There are many ways that this could be done, and I had a look at the
  Java implementation used in Clojure and decided that I didn't really
  want to do much more porting.  So I came up with a couple of ideas
  that are related to Clojure's way of doing it.
</p>
<p>
  The first idea was to make the same tree as used in the vector
  implementation, but to fill it in only as needed.  In essence, this
  was a sparse vector.  The Clojure implementation does something
  similar to this, but goes one step further by using a bit-map to
  signify which branches of the tree are actually used.  In this way,
  it can avoid copying arrays that are mostly full of placeholders.
</p>
<p>
  The next idea was a bit more radical.  It involved making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_trie">radix tree</a> of the input data.  Of all my experiments, this might have been
  the most successful.  In Clojure, its performance is very close to
  the built-in data structure.  In ClojureScript, for some reason it
  is much faster at storing new data than the built-in data structure
  but somewhat slower at retrieving data.  I am thinking that there
  must be some JavaScript-specific reason for this, but I haven't
  found it yet.  It could just be that the ClojureScript data
  structure is asymmetric in the opposite way (I haven't yet looked
  very deeply at it).
</p>
<p>
  In all cases, the theoretical running times are pretty much what
  you'd expect.  To either insert a new key-value pair or to find a
  key, it's basically the sum of the time needed to hash the key, a
  constant to find the place where the key is stored, and then
  something proportional to the number of other keys that have the
  same hash value that have been inserted so far.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, large collections must be hashed each time they're
  inserted or searched for, so using them as keys is probably not a
  great idea.  In Clojure, negative numbers hash to one less than
  their absolute value, so there will probably be collisions if you
  use a large number of positive and negative numbers as keys, but
  it's not that big of a deal, since the number of collisions
  generated by this is at most two.

<p>
  At the very least, this was a good way to learn what's really going
  on under the hood.  I also did a lot of tuning &ndash; not only adding
  typehints, but re-implementing some lazy functions to be non-lazy --
  which is certainly good experience.  I never made a data structure
  that was faster than one of the ones implemented in Java, but I got
  pretty close in both cases.  In order to get meaningful tests, I had
  to do things in a very big way: putting millions of things in
  vectors, and querying hash-maps hundreds of thousands of times.
  Most programs will not do these operations at such scales, and most
  of the tests still took less than a second on my underpowered
  laptop.  That makes me think pretty highly of the existing data
  structures in Clojure.
