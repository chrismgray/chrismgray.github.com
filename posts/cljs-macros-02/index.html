<div id="content">

<p>Most of my time this week was spent traveling and in meetings, but I
did have a chance to work on the Clojurescript macro system that I
have been working on.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Testing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  Things didn't start too well for the system, since it would not run
  the simplest of tests written for it in the Clojurescript testing
  system.  My test was a macro that would take a positive integer,
  recursively decrease it until it was zero, and then output the
  zero.  (Clearly not the smartest macro in the world &ndash; it was just
  meant to test recursion.)  However, I kept getting errors saying
  that the system didn't know how to test equality among numbers.
  This seemed strange until I realized that the <code>extend-type</code> call for
  numbers wasn't getting executed because it wasn't expanded into a
  <code>def</code>.  (I had been executing all <code>def</code> calls, which defined all
  functions and variables, but nothing else.)
</p>
<p>
  So I briefly flirted with executing a bunch of other special forms,
  including <code>set!</code> and <code>deftype</code>, but I could see that this would make
  things pretty unwieldy, and that the compiler would be doing a lot
  of confusing things, for example trying to execute a <code>set!</code> that was
  buried deep inside a function without being able to know anything
  about the locals that it was being set to.
</p>
<p>
  That was clearly the way of madness, so I eventually decided to
  execute every special form that was at the top level.  This worked
  really well, and the tests started passing.
</p>
<p>
  I also added tests to make sure that the namespaces work as
  expected.  You can <code>use</code> or <code>require</code> macros from other namespaces
  just like other functions.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">What's not there (yet)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  So far I have not added the <code>&amp;env</code> and <code>&amp;form</code> variables to macros.
  I expect that it will be necessary to add them at some point (and
  honestly not too hard).  I know they are extremely useful in some
  projects like <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.match">core.match</a>, but that project has already been ported
  to Clojurescript (via Clojure macros), so it might make more sense
  to leave the large macros that need those facilities to Clojure.
</p>
<p>
  Backquoted forms don't work as nicely as in Clojure.  The reason is
  that we are using Clojure's reader, which qualifies backquoted
  symbols with their full namespace.  Unfortunately, it doesn't know
  anything about Clojurescript namespaces, so expect to need to
  qualify symbols inside backquotes.  This is an area where true
  reader macros inside Clojure would be really helpful, but we have to
  live with what we have.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">One step closer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  &hellip; to Clojure in Clojure.  Clojurescript already has a reader and a
  compiler that can compile most of itself.  The reader isn't totally
  complete &ndash; it doesn't have backquote working yet for example &ndash; but
  it is close.  It recently got persistent vectors and persistent
  hash-maps.  With macros added, all that's left for Clojure in
  Clojure is to finish up the reader and get rid of the calls to
  Java.
