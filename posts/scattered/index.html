<p>
  I am doing a bunch of things today, all fairly small.  I think it's
  because I finished working on the time series framework yesterday,
  so I'm kind of at loose ends.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">New programming project</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  One thing that I would like to do is to take all the messages that I
  sent with my <a href="http://findmespot.com">SPOT</a> device while hiking and make a small animation of
  them on Google Maps.  This would be another use of Clojurescript.
  My previous project &ndash; a Clojurescript program for computing the
  Voronoi Diagram of a set of points input by a user &ndash; is a bit
  stalled at the moment, so it's good to have something else to work
  on.  Also, I feel like adding points to a Google Map is something
  that Clojurescript is better suited to, rather than the fiddly
  numeric stuff that I was trying to make it do.  I will come back to
  the Voronoi Diagram at some point (hopefully fairly soon), but I am
  putting it on the back burner for the moment.
</p>
<p>
  So far, I see two major tasks:
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Getting the coordinates and times of the SPOT messages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">


<p>
   Every SPOT message is an email that contains the coordinates of
   where and when the message was sent.  Parsing the email can be done
   offline, so I will probably just use Clojure for that.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Putting them on the Google Map</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
   The <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays.html#Markers">API</a> for using Google Maps appears to be easy to use and
   well-thought-out.  There's even a way to drop the markers at
   different intervals &ndash; just what I want to do.
</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Notmuch</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  I am also playing with the <a href="http://notmuch.org">notmuch</a> email client.  So far I quite
  like it.  It's a heck of a lot faster than my previous mail client,
  mainly because it doesn't do as much.  Like gmail, it is optimized
  towards two operations: searching and tagging.  I never really used
  tags in gmail, because doing so involves clicking around, but it's
  much faster in notmuch.  So far, this seems like the big advantage
  for notmuch.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Git annex</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
  In an effort to use all the software written by <a href="http://joey.kitenet.net/">Joey Hess</a> (not
  really, but it seems like it), I am also trying out <a href="http://git-annex.branchable.com/">git annex</a>.
</p>
<p>
  So far, I have come up with one really compelling use case --
  syncing podcasts to my mp3 player.  My mp3 player has the problem
  that it will delete all the files on it at random times.  Thus, I
  need to keep a backup of all the files on it on my computer.
  However, when I am done listening to a podcast, I like to remove the
  file.  Hopefully, I will be able to sync the files that I remove
  myself (that is, remove them from the laptop), but not the files
  that get removed by the stupid thing crashing.
</p>
<p>
  Another thing that I would like to do is put my music and video
  collections in git annex.  I'm not sure that anything special would
  come from doing that, but it seems nice to have these things in
  version control.
