<p>Section C ended with a couple of rainy days before a night at a Best
Western at Cajon Pass.  It was a restful night, and before long we
were on the trail again.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Cajon Pass to Wrightwood</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  Most passes on the trail are higher than the trail around them, but
  Cajon Pass is the opposite.  So we had another day of climbing ahead
  of us.  This day was more than 5000 feet over about 22 miles.  So
  not very steep, but still a grind.
</p>
<p>
  As I went higher, the landscape changed from desert and chaparral to
  more of a forest.  It also became clear that we were reaching
  elevations where it could snow if there was any precipitation.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SZ19p5esr9U/Tdk5s92ISgI/AAAAAAAABf4/6uz_7f9FouU/s800/DSCF0572.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SZ19p5esr9U/Tdk5s92ISgI/AAAAAAAABf4/6uz_7f9FouU/s800/DSCF0572.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  Given that we had had bad weather over the past couple of days, this
  was a real concern.  The picture above has clouds in it, and I was
  monitoring them all day.  The plan for the day was to end near a
  trail going to the town of Wrightwood and then to spend the next day
  in Wrightwood.  If bad weather hit, we would go into Wrightwood that
  night.
</p>
<p>
  What happened was a bit more complicated than that.  When we got to
  the top of the hill, the weather wasn't great.  The wind was blowing
  fiercely, and it was cold and cloudy, but there was no
  precipitation.  Morevover, we were at a campground with an outhouse
  that all the campers could pile into if the weather got truly
  awful.  Even though the outhouse didn't smell great, we would do it
  if we had to.
</p>
<p>
  We didn't have to, but I awoke the next morning to freezing rain.
  On the trail, I'm generally an early riser, so I was out of camp
  before the others that were camping at the site with me.  Even
  though the trail to town was behind us, I decided to hike to the
  road that was about five miles ahead of us.  I guess I was in a bit
  of a masochistic mood.
</p>
<p>
  As I walked down the trail, ice balls as big as cantaloupes fell
  from the trees around me.  The freezing rain was accompanied by a
  strong wind, and it felt like someone was sandblasting my face.  
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-njjbEhDW0l0/Tdk5_KJN01I/AAAAAAAABgE/ckXeQPMWtq4/s800/DSCF0574.JPG"  alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-njjbEhDW0l0/Tdk5_KJN01I/AAAAAAAABgE/ckXeQPMWtq4/s800/DSCF0574.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  After a while, the trail was covered by snow and ice, and staying on
  it became more difficult.  At one point, I kept going straight after
  it had turned and ended up at a ski hill.  There was a nearby
  maintenance shed, and I stood in its wind shadow to warm up a bit
  and read my maps.  I was near the trail, so I got back on it.  After
  another half mile or so, I was still at the ski hill, but I found a
  warming shed.  The ski hill was closed for the season, but the
  heater in the shed still worked, so I had a chance to warm up for
  real.
</p>
<p>
  At that point, I knew I had two options.  I could either try to stay
  on the trail, or I could go down the ski run that I was sitting at
  the top of.  It is a truism that if you go down a ski run, you will
  eventually find a road at the end, so I knew that would work.  As I
  said, I was having trouble staying on trail, so it was an attractive
  option.  Looking back on it, going down the ski run would probably
  have been smarter, but I decided to try to stay on the trail.
</p>
<p>
  I did get slightly lost a couple more times, but eventually I found
  my way to the road.  As I descended, the weather got better (just
  rain and not freezing rain), but I was still pretty cold and wet by
  the time I got there.
</p>
<p>
  Unbeknownst to me, the road was closed in the direction that traffic
  would be coming towards town, so hitching was <i>really</i> hard.  Since
  I was cold and wet, I decided to keep moving, and walk towards
  town.  A few miles down the road there was an intersection which
  meant that finally there would be traffic in the correct direction
  on the road, so I got a hitch the rest of the way.
</p>
<p>
  I had a nice time in Wrightwood, where I stayed in a room with Holden and
  (Head)Banger.  We went out for Mexican food at a place that
  advertised 5 cent margaritas with your meal.  Of course, only the
  first was 5 cents, but Holden didn't realize that.  Or perhaps he
  didn't want to realize it because it was his birthday.  In any case,
  he had quite a few of them, and it was a pretty fun night.

<h2 id="sec-2">Mount Baden-Powell</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  After a large pancake breakfast, I got a ride back to the trail.
  The first half of the day was flat and easy, and then I got to Mount
  Baden-Powell.  Initially, it was easy too, though steeper than most
  of the trail we had encountered so far, and then I got to the
  snow.  Even that didn't seem too bad &ndash; someone had gone up it on
  skis, so the trail was easy to follow.  I met another hiker on the
  way up (I can't for the life of me remember his trail name), and we
  decided to stick together going up the mountain.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f0WndvmwhK8/Tdk6NjGRdRI/AAAAAAAADO4/H1NMH8DyaT4/s800/DSCF0576.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f0WndvmwhK8/Tdk6NjGRdRI/AAAAAAAADO4/H1NMH8DyaT4/s800/DSCF0576.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  Near the top of the mountain, the PCT turns and traverses the face
  of the mountain, and another trail keeps going to the top.
  Traverses are scarier to me than ridge walking, so we took the trail
  to the top.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CBjbZoP7fWA/Tdk68VDz2DI/AAAAAAAABhQ/mwhBNd_L0rk/s800/DSCF0584.JPG"  alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-CBjbZoP7fWA/Tdk68VDz2DI/AAAAAAAABhQ/mwhBNd_L0rk/s800/DSCF0584.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  Now here is where things get funny.  As you can see in the picture
  above, there was quite a fog that day.  So, following footsteps
  rather than our compasses, we went down the wrong ridge.  In the
  picture below, we were supposed to follow the red line, but we
  followed the orange one instead.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="./../mountainmishap.png"><img src="../mountainmishap.png" alt="mountainmishap.png"/></a>
</p>

<p>
  knew that we were lost.  What we didn't know was just how lost we
  were.  We started scouting around for the trail, going back to
  places where we had last seen footprints, and following animal paths
  to dead ends.  By the time we got our compasses out, we were off the
  map, but it didn't matter.  It was clear that we were going the
  wrong direction.
</p>
<p>
  Before we figured out exactly what had happened, Garby happened upon
  us.  He had gone down the path to Wrightwood rather than the road,
  so he had been a few hours behind us all day.  He had seen our
  footprints and assumed that we were going the right way.  So now
  there were three of us that were lost.
</p>
<p>
  Once Garby showed up, though, we figured out what had happened
  pretty quickly.  It was clear that we would have to walk all the way
  back up Mount Baden-Powell, and go down the correct ridge.  By this
  time, however, the sun was setting, so we needed to camp.  It was a
  new experience for me, camping while lost.  It was not particularly
  pleasant.  I remember getting up during the night and seeing that
  the fog had cleared.  The moon was bright, and I could see the ridge
  that we needed to walk down.
</p>
<p>
  We were all up early the next morning, partly because we wanted to
  be back on the trail and officially un-lost, and partly because we
  were all almost out of water.  We hiked back up the mountain and
  down the correct ridge to a beautiful spring, with water coming out
  of the side of the mountain.

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Podcasts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">


<p>
  Let me take a quick diversion here to talk about the process of
  hiking, rather than the journey.  On the AT I resisted technology
  for a long time.  On the PCT, however, I started the trail with an
  mp3 player.  I would charge and refill it with podcasts every chance
  that I got.  Some people hate any technology on the trail (except
  all the technologically-advanced stuff that they carry on their
  back, but I digress even further), but I think that listening to
  podcasts really helped me cement the experience in my brain.  I have
  trail memories triggered by my favorite podcasts all the time.
</p>
<p>
  I can picture exactly where I was when I was listening to the guys
  on <a href="http://thebuglepodcast.com/">The Bugle</a> make fun of the hype surrounding the royal wedding.
  And now, whenever they mention it, I picture that place.  When I was
  going up the hill out of Cajon Pass, I was listening to an interview
  on <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/">Fresh Air</a> with a couple who filmed lions.  On the way down Mount
  Baden-Powell, I was listening to Tig Notaro on <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/jordan-jesse-go">Jordan, Jesse, Go</a>.  I
  heard Tig on another podcast the other day and immediately thought
  of the whole experience.  Even more than a year later, these are
  completely vivid memories, and I think the fact that I was making
  mental connections between what I was listening to and the place
  that I was hiking through helped that.
</p>
<p>
  So anyway to distill it to two words: podcasts good.  Just always
  have one earbud out if you are walking in a place that could have
  snakes.

<div id="outline-container-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">Frog Detour and Station Fire Burn area</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
  The next couple of days are a bit of a blur (though I could tell you
  what I listened to).  It was a beautiful area, but perhaps the
  slightly traumatic experience of getting so lost pushed the memories
  out of my head.
</p>
<p>
  One thing that does stick out is a long road walk to detour around
  the habitat of an endangered species of frog.  I later heard that
  horseback riders are likely more damaging to the frogs' habitat than
  hikers, so I would have been fine going through the detour, but I
  did the detour in any case.
</p>
<p>
  The day after the frog-detour day, the trail went through the burn
  zone of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_Fire_(2009)#Los_Angeles_County">Station Fire</a>.  An act of arson, this fire had been so
  bad that it burned down the ranger station.  They were rebuilding
  at the time that we were there, which is a good thing to see, but a
  burn zone is a pretty sad thing for me.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Boris</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">


<p>
   In the <a href="./../socal-03">last section</a>, I mentioned that there was a funny story with
   Boris and LoL.  Around the frog detour, just past Mount
   Baden-Powell, LoL went into the bushes to go to the bathroom and
   Boris passed him without LoL knowing it.  Boris was in the zone,
   moving fast, and even though he and LoL had been hiking together,
   he didn't wait around for LoL.  With his head down, he even missed
   a turn and went a little way on a wrong path before realizing it
   and bushwhacking down to the correct path.
</p>
<p>
   After half a day of not seeing his buddy, LoL got concerned.
   Assuming that Boris was behind him, LoL decided to wait for Boris.
   When he got word from hikers behind him that they had seen a place
   where a hillside had been torn up and it looked like someone had
   fallen down the mountain, LoL had all the reason he needed to panic
   and call in search and rescue.  They sent a team to the place where
   the possible fall had been seen, but found no Boris.  They had
   sheriffs go to all the campgrounds in the area and yell his name
   (one of them woke me up).
</p>
<p>
   Boris was at the same campground as Garby, about 10 miles ahead of
   me, and had no idea that so much was going on in his honor.  When
   he found out, he was mightily embarrassed, and that's how he got
   his trail name of Overdrive.  My theory is that he didn't want to
   be associated with the name that the sheriffs had been yelling.

<h2 id="sec-5">Vasquez Rocks and Hiker Heaven</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
  It had been an eventful section, and there were two last treats.
  The first was the Vasquez Rocks.  Huge weather-worn rocks sticking
  out of the desert, they epitomize what I think of as a western
  scene.  For good reason, it turns out.  They have been used in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_productions_using_the_Vasquez_Rocks_as_a_filming_location">quite a lot of movies and TV shows</a> that want to have a "Western"
  location.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  It is quite a touristy location, to the extent that they even have
  placards along the path identifying the flora.  I was a bit
  surprised to see that they even had one identifying poison oak.  I
  would think that it would be easier to remove the poison oak than to
  put up a sign saying what it is, but I guess that shows what I know.

<h3 id="sec-5-1">Hiker Heaven</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">


<p>
   Just past the Vasquez Rocks is a hostel appropriately named Hiker
   Heaven.  It's run by the Saufleys, who are a great couple who
   happen to have a large yard and love hikers.  I took a zero there,
   and got a ride to an outfitter near LA where I got a couple of
   things that I had been needing.
