<h2 id="sec-1">4-State Challenge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  The challenges long-distance hikers create for themselves are
  essentially stupid.  You generally don't get anything for completing
  them, and they have a tendency to make you feel bad.  For example,
  on the PCT, there is a challenge that involves hiking from a town to
  a hostel while drinking a beer every mile.  Since the distance
  between the places is 24 miles, it seems remarkably foolhardy to
  me.
</p>
<p>
  With that out of the way, let me tell you about the challenge that I
  did.  It involves hiking in 4 states in under 24 hours.  I started
  in Pennsylvania, hiked most of the day in Maryland, went through
  Harpers Ferry in West Virginia, and ended the day in Virginia.
</p>
<p>
  I started the day just after midnight, and wished Picker and Grinner
  a silent "good luck".  Even though there was a nearly-full moon, the
  night was pretty dark, and I needed my head lamp all night.  Shortly
  into Maryland, I tweaked my ankle pretty badly, and so I was slowed
  a bit for the rest of the night.
</p>
<p>
  By 4 in the morning, I had not gone very far, and I decided to take
  a nap.  I found a reasonably flat rock and laid down right beside
  the trail.  I slept until about 6, by which time the sun was coming
  up.
</p>
<p>
  I had gone around 20 miles by lunch time, so I took it at the
  Washington Monument:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  This is clearly not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_monument">Washington Monument</a> that is in Washington,
  DC, but it was the first one, and that should count for something.
</p>
<p>
  The trail in Maryland was pretty good, and there was a lot of
  history associated with the places that I was hiking.  In some
  sense, it is a shame that I went through so quickly.  In particular,
  the last shelter in Maryland was one of the nicest that I saw.
</p>
<p>
  It was about 6 or 7 by the time I left Maryland, and the sun was
  starting to set.  I entered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Ferry">Harpers Ferry</a> and started to look for a
  place to get some food.  It took me a while to get my bearings, and
  by the time I found a street with bars and restaurants, they were
  all closed.  It seems that Harpers Ferry is completely a
  tourist town, and no restaurants are open after about 8:00.
  Finally, I found a restaurant with open doors and went in, despite a
  sign saying that the restaurant was closed.  I practically begged
  the waitress to get me some food, and in the end I overpaid quite a
  lot for a mediocre sandwich.
</p>
<p>
  I went to the headquarters of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy,
  which was also closed, and looked around, trying to find a hose.
  Someone must have thought that I looked suspicious, because one of
  the workers eventually showed up and showed me where the hose was.
  I filled my water bottles, thanked the employee, and went on my
  way.
</p>
<p>
  It seems cruel, but the trail climbs a hill for about two miles from
  Harpers Ferry to the Virginia border.  I had walked 43 miles by the
  time I made it to the border, and I was completely beat.  I hung my
  hammock just past the border sign and settled into bed at about
  10:30 PM.
</p>
<p>
  I awoke the next morning later than usual, and hung most of my gear
  in a tree.  I wanted to go back to Harpers Ferry, since it is
  customary for thru-hikers to visit the ATC and have their picture
  taken.  So I went back with a mostly-empty pack.  I had my picture
  taken and hung around until nearly noon.  During the time that I was
  there, some section-hikers also came in.  We talked for a while
  about the differences between the thru-hiking experience and the
  section-hiking experience, and they gave me some of their
  freeze-dried meals, which were of a much higher quality than the
  meals I generally ate.

<p>
  Eventually, I left the ATC.  I climbed the hill again, got the rest
  of my gear, and hiked about 7 miles further down the trail.  The
  next day I did 10 miles by lunch time and called it a day at a
  really nice hostel: the Bear's Den.  If you are ever in the
  Washington, DC area and would like a hostel experience, this is the
  place for you.
</p>
<p>
  I lounged and let my legs recuperate.  The Bear's Den has a nice
  deal where you can stay at the hostel, get a frozen pizza and a pint
  of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream for pretty cheap.  Even though I had
  recently completed the half-gallon challenge, I was certainly ready
  for some Ben &amp; Jerry's.
</p>
<p>
  After the Bear's Den, there is a section of trail called "The
  Roller Coaster".  This is primarily meant to scare northbounders who
  haven't seen any real mountains yet.  The terrain is a bit bumpy,
  but there was really nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
  The following day I stopped in at Front Royal, VA for a resupply.  I
  had to wait a very long time for a hitch (the famed Southern
  hospitality had apparently not yet kicked in).  I noticed that my
  pocket knife was missing, so I called the Bear's Den, and they had
  found it.  They very generously sent it on to me at a town that was
  down the trail.  I left Front Royal, and camped just a couple of
  miles before boundary of Shenandoah National Park.
</p>
<p>
  My experience in "The Shennies" was not great.  It rained nearly the
  whole time that I was there, and there is a road that the trail
  crosses something like 20 times in the park.  By the last day, I had
  determined that the rain jacket that I had was not really
  waterproof, and when it got really wet it just made me colder.  I
  had rain pants, but they were not breathable at all, so my legs
  would get nearly as wet from sweat as they would from rain.  On the
  last day, I procrastinated in the shelter as long as I could (I
  finished the book I was reading), and then went back out into the
  rain.
</p>
<p>
  I walked 20 miles that day without stopping on trails that were more
  like creeks.  I left Shenandoah and was very glad to do so.  Just
  past the boundary is another road, and I somewhat forced myself on a
  motorist to take me into Waynesboro, VA.  When I got to Waynesboro,
  the sun was coming out, and I was able to camp in town rather than
  paying for a hotel.  I took a shower at the YMCA, had a meal in a
  restaurant, and finally felt better.

  Central Virginia.  If I'm feeling ambitious, also Southern
  Virginia.  Once I get there, the trail's almost done.
