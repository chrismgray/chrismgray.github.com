<p>
  In my <a href="./../north-va">previous post</a>, I mentioned what a hard time I had in the
  Shenandoah National Park because of the rain.  In Waynesboro, I
  decided to do something about that.  I mailed my rain jacket home
  and went to an outfitters to get a new one.  I got a nice compact
  down jacket while I was at it.
</p>
<p>
  There is a diner in town that has all-you-can-eat pancakes, so
  breakfast and lunch were taken care of.  I couldn't walk very fast
  with so much food in my stomach, though, so I didn't go far past
  Waynesboro.  At the shelter, I met Farm-a-sea, whose trail name had
  a double meaning.  He was training to become a fish farmer when he
  wasn't hiking, and he also had a sizable cache of medicinal herbs.
  He was an interesting guy though.  He would pack a dozen eggs and a
  large hunk of bacon out of town.  He had a skillet for frying them
  in, and would build a fire at every shelter and cook his supper in
  the skillet.  Really old-school stuff.
</p>

  The terrain in Virginia became hilly once again.  After the flatness
  of Pennsylvania, this took some getting used to.  Also, since
  Southern Pennsylvania, the leaves had been falling, and by Central
  Virginia, they were falling in earnest.

  It was in this section that I realized that I had not packed enough
  food for the number of days that I would need if I was going to
  continue at the same average speed.  Thus, I needed to pick up my
  average mileage considerably.  I did two 30-mile days and two
  25-mile days into Daleville.  There was some interesting scenery on
  the way, including this rock formation, rather ominously named "The
  Guillotine":

</p>
<p>
  By the time I got to Daleville, I was in a pretty serious calorie
  deficit.  I went and had a big supper at a crappy Mexican
  restaurant, followed by two beers from the store in my motel room.
  I could tell midway through the second beer that it wasn't a good
  idea.

  I was hung over all the next day.  However, following my experience
  from the previous week, I tried to make miles and not allow it to
  slow me down.  I didn't want to be stuck without food once again.
  Hiking with a hangover is really terrible, though, and it seemed
  like every 10 minutes I needed to sit down or bend over and try to
  vomit.  I didn't get anything out all day, but I didn't eat anything
  either, so by the end of the day I was getting hungry.  I took this
  as a good sign and ate some Teriyaki Noodles.  I couldn't keep them
  down through the night, but after I had gone into the woods to
  deposit them on the ground, I finally felt better.  However, the
  memory of that day has been enough to keep me from drinking alcohol
  ever since.

  The next days were better, though marred by bad trail maintenance
  and ragweed.  One highlight was the second-largest oak tree on the
  trail:

</p>
<p>
  The day after that picture was taken, I ended up at The Captain's
  place, a small hostel with tenting in the yard.  The really
  interesting feature of it was that you needed to take a cable car
  across the creek to get there.
</p>
<p>
  The following day, I ended up at Pearisburg.  It is another
  spread-out town, and I had to walk a couple of miles to get to the
  store.  However, I had had a sleeping bag sent there because mine
  had been leaking feathers for quite a while, and I was able to pick
  it up, so that was nice.
</p>
<p>
  I went to the Woods Hole hostel the next day, which was a greatly
  relaxing day.  One of the hostel-keepers teaches yoga and the other
  is a masseur (though the massages weren't free, and I didn't feel
  like getting one).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  After Woods Hole, I really started rolling.  I did a 20-mile day the
  next day and a 34-mile day the day after that.  This took me to the
  Chestnut Knob shelter, which is a completely enclosed shelter on the
  top of a mountain.  It was windy all night, but I slept fairly
  comfortably after my long day.
</p>
<p>
  The next two days weren't too special.  I stayed in a motel near the
  interstate and a shelter that was reportedly haunted (though I saw
  no evidence of a haunting).  The day after that, though I entered
  the Grayson Highlands State Park.  This is a park that is famous for
  the wild ponies that roam it.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  I got a picture with me near them that shows how small they really
  are.
</p>
<p>

  I had heard that they will come up to you and lick or chew your pack
  in order to get the salt from your sweat, but that didn't happen to
  me.
</p>
<p>
  Just before I got to the Grayson Highlands, I met up with another
  group of hikers: Skittles, Flora, Abear, and Coyote.  I had been
  following most of them in the shelter logs for months, so it was
  like meeting old friends.  Flora in particular signed her name with
  a large flower (her hiking partner Fauna had left near Washington,
  DC), so her entries were hard to miss.  We hiked together off and on
  for a few days, and it was nice to be hiking with people once again.
</p>
<p>
  We all stopped together in Damascus, VA and found cheap
  accommodation in a building run by a local church.  It was empty,
  but it had strict rules (no cooking in the rooms was the one they
  seemed most concerned with) and a person came during the night to
  make sure that we were following them.  I found a new pair of shoes
  on sale in Damascus, so I got them and got rid of my previous pair
  which were falling apart.  They had only lasted about 500 miles.
</p>
<p>
  I left Damascus early the next day, leaving the group behind.
  Skittles would catch up with me and we would hike together a bit
  longer, but I didn't see the rest again.  Just past Damascus, I left
  Virginia for Tennessee.
