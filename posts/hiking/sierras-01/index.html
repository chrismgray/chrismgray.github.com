<p>I just got back from a few days in the mountains hiking with my mom
and sister, so I thought I would write a bit more of my rememberances
from last year.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Leaving Kennedy Meadows</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  After a couple of nights in Kennedy Meadows, I was ready to get back
  on the trail.  There was a group leaving a couple hours before I
  would be ready, so I checked and made sure that they would be okay
  with me tagging along.  I really didn't want to do the mountains
  alone.
</p>
<p>
  Before long, I left and hiked five or ten miles before I caught the
  group.  The group consisted of Buffalo, Pyrite, Chinchilla,
  Zombiefeet, Ryan, and Sue.  The first day, we didn't see any snow,
  but that would not last long.  Our packs were much heavier than
  usual, since we had bear canisters to keep our food safe, and ice
  axes to keep our bodies safe.
</p>
<p>
  We made our way into the mountains.  The group was larger than I was
  used to, and so we hiked a bit slower than I normally did.  Getting
  consensus that we would start hiking againg after breaks was
  difficult.  I started to get antsy.  There were some upsides to the
  size of the group, though.  Pyrite knew how to use an ice axe and
  gave us all a quick lesson.  When we hit snow on the second day, we
  were able to find our way relatively quickly.
</p>
<p>
  On the second day, our group got even bigger, as we were joined by
  the French Team, a husband and wife duo from &ndash; you guessed it --
  France.  
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="sec-2">Snow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  My attitude toward snow upon leaving Kennedy Meadows was that I
  didn't think it would be much of a problem.  After all, as a
  Canadian, I walk on snow 4 or 5 months of the year.  I hadn't
  anticipated two things.  First, it is nearly impossible to find the
  trail when everything around is covered by snow, and second, a high
  amount of snow means a high amount of snowmelt.  The second
  consideration would come later, but by our third day in the Sierra,
  we were very glad that the French Team had a GPS.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Early on the fourth day, we came to Chicken Spring Lake.  The maps
  list it as a water source.  This is what it looked like to us.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fklZyjFIKu0/TnvN_4Io-KI/AAAAAAAACfM/qrVE1Ax_Ppo/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fklZyjFIKu0/TnvN_4Io-KI/AAAAAAAACfM/qrVE1Ax_Ppo/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  We started to learn how to "boot-ski".  On slopes that are steep
  enough, you can let your shoes slip and then you start sliding down
  the slope.  As long as the slope isn't too steep, you can go for
  quite a while and have a lot of fun.  It also broke up the hiking a
  little bit, which was becoming a bit of a trudge.  The snow was
  packed quite firm, but even the firmest snow is harder to walk on
  than dirt.
</p>
<p>
  By the end of our fifth day, we got to Crabtree Meadows.  I had been
  hoping to climb Mount Whitney (the highest mountain in the contintal
  US), and to do so we would need to take a side-trail.  However, I
  had to balance that with my need to stay with a group.  I was quite
  liking the group that I was with, and one by one, they decided not
  to attempt the climb.  It was a hard decision, but I gave up on the
  idea of climbing Whitney as part of my PCT hike.  With the benefit
  of hindsight, I am pretty sure that it was the right decision.  The
  miles ahead were among the hardest I had ever hiked and I was nearly
  out of food.  If I had needed to hurry, things could have gone
  terribly wrong.

<h2 id="sec-3">Passes</h2>

<p>
  The next day was all about getting close to Forester Pass.  The
  consensus from hikers who had done the trail in previous years was
  that it was best to do the passes in the morning, before the snow
  got slushy.  So we wanted to get close to the pass (the highest
  point on the trail) in order to do that.
</p>
<p>
  The hiking was starting to get spectacular.  Everything was covered
  in snow and there were giant mountains all around.  We only made it
  about 8 miles that day, but they were 8 hard-fought miles.  Our
  large group found the last cluster of trees with snowless patches to
  camp in, and we ate a slightly early supper and turned in.
</p>
<p>
  The weather was great the next morning, and we started out with
  great moods.  This picture of Pyrite and Chinchilla walking toward
  Forester Pass is one of my favorites:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Eventually we got to the real climb before the pass.  Unfortunately,
  I don't have any pictures that do it justice.  It started off with a
  few hundred feet of what seemed like climbing straight up.  There
  were steps in the snow that someone had made the day before, so I
  used those.  I also had my ice axe out just in case I slipped or the
  snow gave way.  At the top of the steps were some rocks.  This was
  the actual trail, with switchbacks.  The rocks were icy because the
  snow had melted the day before and frozen during the night.  It was
  not fun climbing up them, but once I was up I was glad to be on the
  switchbacks.
</p>
<p>
  The gladness didn't last very long.  The switchbacks abruptly ended,
  crossed by a chute of icy snow.  It was even more vertical than the
  steps we had just climbed, and as a bonus there were jagged rocks at
  the bottom.  Any slip would give you almost no chance of saving
  yourself.  To top it off, the snow was so hard and icy that the ice
  axe wouldn't go in.  There were steps carved across the chute, but
  they seemed to have been carved by a giant.  To say that I was
  scared when I was crossing them would be a massive understatement.
  It's not something that I want to do again.  (It would have been
  much less scary if we had crossed in the afternoon when the snow was
  slushy, but that's something we didn't know at the time.)
</p>
<p>
  Once I crossed the chute of death, it was just a few more
  switchbacks on terra firma before I got to the top.  I had to sit
  down and hold my knees to get rid of the adrenaline that was
  flowing.  The rest of the group caught up about five minutes later,
  and we celebrated being at the highest point of the hike.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  We started our descent from the pass and very soon got to do our
  first glissading.  Glissading is a fancy word for sitting on your
  bum and sliding.  It's a ton of fun.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XAlZSZ7ihOI/TnveTYNPvQI/AAAAAAAADYE/EsdF9RxtzB0/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XAlZSZ7ihOI/TnveTYNPvQI/AAAAAAAADYE/EsdF9RxtzB0/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  We descended more than 3000 feet and then started climbing again.
  Our next day would take us into town, so we wanted to get as close
  as possible.  We camped near Bullfrog Lake, and because campsites
  were so scarce, I camped quite a distance from the rest of the
  group.
</p>
<p>
  I awoke the next morning having decided that I was sick of the
  snow.  It was causing us to hike too slowly and get too tired.  I
  just wanted out.  I started hiking without the group and got a
  little off trail.  I did, however, get a picture of this fellow, who
  I think is a pine marten.  He was quite curious about me.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XKMvPHGFmbo/TnviJ59CFdI/AAAAAAAACkg/fc8nVttcjT0/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XKMvPHGFmbo/TnviJ59CFdI/AAAAAAAACkg/fc8nVttcjT0/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  I ended up a good distance above the trail and eventually saw the
  rest of the group pass below me.  It was somewhat embarassing to
  climb down and catch up with them, but I was still glad to see
  them.  We got to Kearsarge Pass without much incident, but the snow
  seemed treacherous again on the other side.  We had to descend a
  long way from the pass to get to the road, and it was after noon by
  the time we got there.  Eventually, we got a ride into the small
  town of Independence.

<p>
  As I said, I had decided to get out of the snow.  My strategy was to
  get to Oregon, where my mom and sister would be vacationing and then
  have them drive me back to Independence after a couple of weeks.  I
  was joined on this road trip by Zombiefeet and Ryan, who had planned
  to end their hike at Independence and who needed to get to
  Washington for a wedding.
</p>
<p>  
  Getting to Oregon was a bit difficult logistically.  The first thing
  we did was hitch up to Mammoth Lakes.  It wasn't an easy hitch, but
  eventually a BMW <img src="../../../smileys/idea.png" alt="(!)" /> driven by a single lady <img src="../../../smileys/idea.png" alt="(!)" /> pulled over and
  gave all three of us <img src="../../../smileys/idea.png" alt="(!)" /> a ride.  It even turned out that we had
  grown up in the same city, so we had something to talk about.
</p>
<p>
  From Mammoth, we were able to rent a car.  It's kind of strange
  driving after a month and a half of walking, but nevertheless I
  drove most of the way to Ashland, Oregon.  I said my goodbyes to
  Zombiefeet and Ryan, handed them the keys, and was on my own again.

  Out of Ashland, I was happy to be on snow-free trail once more.
</p>

  I was cursing my luck the same day when I came to a large patch of
  snow.  It was easily crossed, though, and then the path was bare for
  a while longer.  The next day had a climb, and the higher I went,
  the snowier it got.  When I finally got to the top, it was as snowy
  as it had been in California.  I was on my own without a GPS and I
  got lost.  By this time, I was pretty used to the sensation of being
  lost, and knew that as long as I went down the mountain in the
  correct general direction I would be fine.
</p>
<p>
  And that was the case.  I slept on it, and found some snowmobile
  paths the next day.  I followed them to a larger road and came out
  nearly on the trail.  Later that day, I would come to so-called lava
  fields.  Obviously, this isn't the molten rock of the movies, but
  it's the rocks that formed after cooling off.  It's not too much fun
  to walk on because the rocks are awkwardly sized and shift
  constantly under your feet.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  As you can see from that picture, I was coming to another mountain
  with plenty of snow.  Since the whole point of coming to Oregon was
  to get out of the snow, I didn't feel like going into it.  I called
  off my plan to keep hiking in Oregon and took a week off at my
  grandparents' house with my mom and sister.
