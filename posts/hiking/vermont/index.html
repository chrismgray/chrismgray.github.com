<h2 id="sec-1">Hanover to Rutland </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
  After an enjoyable two days in Hanover, it was time to hit the road
  again.  Unfortunately, the first few miles of the trail in Vermont
  are actually on road.  Road walks are bad for a hiker for a few
  reasons.  For one thing, you are taken out of the wilderness
  experience whenever you see the road.  For another, the hard surface
  tends to hurt your feet far more quickly than trail.  While there
  were times during the hike that I was glad to be walking on road
  (mainly after hiking the rocky trails of Pennsylvania), a good trail
  is almost always preferable.
</p>
<p>
  Rain started around lunch time, and by the time I arrived at the
  shelter, it was a downpour.  I was still not comfortable sleeping in
  shelters at this point of the hike, so I set up my hammock anyway.
  However, I went to the shelter to cook supper and found that
  sleeping there would not have been an option anyway.  It was full of
  northbounders &ndash; roughly the end of the wave of northbounders that
  happens every year on the trail.
</p>
<p>
  The rain brought out some red efts from their hiding places.  These
  are juvenile newts that look somewhat like plastic toys.  I was
  never able to get a great photo of them, but this is one of the
  better ones:

</p>
<p>
  The weather was better the next day, and I made good time.  During
  the day, I met up with Just Jill, who had been staying at the same
  shelter as me.  (Just X is a common trail name for people named X
  who can't decide on a trail name.)  She had started the trail much
  earlier than me, but had family near Hanover and was just getting
  back on the trail.  We chatted a bit about people that I only knew
  from reading log books at shelters and then went on.  Late in the
  day, I got some pretty bad chafing from the previous day's moisture
  and had to knock off before I got to my intended destination.
</p>
<p>
  The following day was only notable because it marked the junction of
  the AT with the Long Trail, the oldest long-distance hiking trail in
  the US.  I caught up with Just Jill again at the end of the day, at
  a shelter near the top of Mount Killington.  We agreed that we would
  get up early the next day to go to the top and take pictures.
</p>
<p>
  I did get up early the next morning, but didn't wake Just Jill.
  However, I did get some very nice pictures.

<p>
  From there, the day was all downhill (literally, not
  metaphorically).  I crossed 500 miles and saw an owl.

<p>
  That night, I got to a road and decided to go to Rutland, VT.  My
  sister was playing in a musical competition that weekend, and I was
  able to take the train up to Montreal to see her.  But not before I
  stayed at a hostel run by the <a href="http://www.twelvetribes.com/">Twelve Tribes</a> &ndash; a sort of religious
  commune that some characterize as a cult, but who were very nice to
  me.  And they had great food and smoothies.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
  After the trip to Montreal, I was back to Rutland to start where I
  left off.  Since I got back to the trail late in the evening, I only
  walked to the first shelter a couple of miles down the trail.  I saw
  in the log book that Picker and Grinner had been there the day
  before, meaning that they were now ahead of me (I had been ahead of
  them since we split up at the beginning of the Whites).
</p>
<p>
  I was so excited at the prospect of catching back up with Picker and
  Grinner that I woke up at about 3:30 the next morning and, since I
  couldn't get back to sleep, I packed up and started walking.  I was
  undeterred by darkness, hills, rain, lightning, and trail re-routes
  and just kept walking all day.  Later in the day, after I had walked
  at least 20 miles, I started hearing about "the best hostel on the
  trail".  I decided to make that my destination, even though it was
  another 10 miles or so.  I borrowed a mobile phone and called ahead
  to reserve a bunk.  I asked whether Picker and Grinner were there,
  and was given even more motivation to keep going when I found out
  that they were.
</p>
<p>
  The last few miles of the day were down a ski run, and when I got to
  the bottom I was just about as tired as I'd ever been.  However, I
  did my shopping and waited to get picked up by the guy who runs the
  hostel.  When I got to the hostel, it was as nice as it had been
  hyped to be.  It was clean and had trail memorabilia decorating the
  whole place.  On top of that, you get a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice
  cream as part of the low fee for staying there.
</p>
<p>
  Besides Picker and Grinner, there were two other couples staying at
  the hostel &ndash; Lucky and Charm as well as Sherpa and Boss Lady. One
  fun way we passed the time that evening was to have everyone weigh
  their packs.  As you might expect, Sherpa's pack weight more than
  Boss Lady's, but Charm was a bit miffed to find out that her pack
  weighed at least 10 pounds more than Lucky's.  Plus, she was
  carrying a big camera, as she was (is?) an aspiring photographer.
</p>
<p>
  The next day, I was rather sore, but after the effort that I had put
  in to catch Picker and Grinner, I was not going to sit around and
  let them get ahead of me again.  Thankfully, they didn't want to go
  too far either, so we found a nice river about ten miles down the
  trail and set up an early camp.  I hung up a bear bag comically low
  to the ground, and people took pictures standing next to it.
</p>
<p>
  I don't remember much from the next day, but the day after that we
  went to Bennington, VT to resupply.  It was there where we had our
  easiest hitch &ndash; before we even stuck our thumbs out, an old gent
  pulled over and offered us a ride back to the trail.  He was an
  entertaining guy &ndash; a veteran from the Korean War who was going
  skydiving for his eightieth birthday the following week.
</p>
<p>
  We slept near a shelter that night where there was a gaggle of
  northbounders, some of whom were roasting marshmallows over a camp
  fire (neither of which is a common occurrence for me &ndash; I'm usually
  too tired to have a camp fire at the end of the day, and
  marshmallows just waste space in the pack, but they sure were tasty
  that night), and I joined them for a little while.  One of them had
  a violin and was trying to learn to play as she was on her hike, so
  I borrowed it and played a little.  All in all, it was a great day.
</p>
<p>
  That night, it rained, and a dead branch fell near Picker and
  Grinner's tent &ndash; a good reminder that Mother Nature doesn't care if
  you just had a great day; she'll still try to mess it up for you.
  Luckily, though, no one was hurt.
</p>
<p>
  The next morning, we made it to the border and completed our third
  state.
