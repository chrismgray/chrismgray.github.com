<p>After my zero at Hiker Heaven, I started on my way into the fifth
section of the trail, which is notable for containing about twenty
miles of actual desert.  Before this, everything that had seemed like
a desert was actually chaparral.  The map, usually shaded with green
and brown, was completely white.  But I am getting ahead of myself.
</p>

<p>
  It is customary for PCT hikers to leave Hiker Heaven and then hike
  directly to the Anderson's, which is about 23 miles away.  Having
  just spent a very nice zero day at Hiker Heaven, I didn't feel any
  need to do that.  I was walking by myself and feeling good.  I had
  let Garby leave a little earlier than me, and knowing his speed, I
  was fairly confident that he would be ahead of me all day.  Some
  days you just want to walk alone.  I reached the road to the
  Anderson's in the early afternoon and decided to keep going.  Just
  past the road, I found a dead horny toad and took a picture of it:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8X3kmfL8y8E/Tnu9q5-AZKI/AAAAAAAACac/LeTdqQGpbpc/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8X3kmfL8y8E/Tnu9q5-AZKI/AAAAAAAACac/LeTdqQGpbpc/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  I walked five or six more miles that evening before finding a nice
  grove of trees with a small clearing inside for my hammock.  There
  was even a nice little stream nearby.  I did not catch up to Garby
  and was not sure if I would catch him again on the hike.
</p>
<p>
  I was up early the next morning and walked about 100 yards when I
  came upon Garby packing up his campsite.  To me, it was a pretty
  good indication that we were really good hiking partners.  After
  nearly thirty miles of hiking, we had independently decided to call
  it a day within a distance that could be sprinted in 10 seconds.
</p>
<p>
  We passed the 500-mile marker that afternoon (though it was quite a
  distance past where the maps indicated that it should be).
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vo6fdjs5_uY/Tnu_b6GGilI/AAAAAAAACbA/ffFV4E3X-s4/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vo6fdjs5_uY/Tnu_b6GGilI/AAAAAAAACbA/ffFV4E3X-s4/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  The trail also became more wooded and shaded, which was nice because
  the weather was pretty hot.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-r_5XUEmDZ3A/Tnu_sF5KHvI/AAAAAAAACbE/dUUMgHrHCsM/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-r_5XUEmDZ3A/Tnu_sF5KHvI/AAAAAAAACbE/dUUMgHrHCsM/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  And some of the trees had absolutely huge pine cones.  They were
  heavy too.  I kicked one, thinking that it would have the same
  papery weight that I am used to pine cones having, and nearly hurt
  my foot.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  Eventually, though, we descended from the forested ridge toward the
  desert.  A few miles before the desert actually starts, there is
  some private property with no camping allowed.  Garby and I decided
  to camp as close to that property line as possible and to get an
  early start the next morning.

<p>
  As we agreed, Garby and I got up at 3:30 in the morning and started
  walking toward the desert.  The moon was just past full, but it was
  not quite bright enough that we did not need our headlamps.  I had
  night-hiked <a href="./../north-va">before</a>, and did not really like it.  This time was a
  little better, but I still stumbled more than I would have liked.
  However, I knew that this was the best way to beat the heat of the
  desert.
</p>
<p>
  We got to the LA aqueduct just after daybreak.  We filled our water
  containers to their capacity there and then started walking in a
  straight line.  The trail follows the aqueduct (which is mostly
  buried after your first encounter with it) across most of the
  desert.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o4F_F2AaOxY/TnvAnfsDv8I/AAAAAAAACbY/0pQAPGDwATs/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o4F_F2AaOxY/TnvAnfsDv8I/AAAAAAAACbY/0pQAPGDwATs/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  It has a round top, which is slightly annoying to walk on, but it is
  better than sand.
</p>
<p>
  It's fairly hard to describe walking in the desert and make it seem
  exciting.  Nothing happens suddenly, like it can in the mountains.
  It is all very gradual.  Eventually you notice that it's gotten
  really oppressively hot.  Your water gets hot.  You want to sit
  down, but there's no point, because there's no shade anywhere.  It'd
  just be a waste of time.  So you keep walking.  Eventually we came
  to a bridge that was about 2 feet off the ground, and I sat for
  about ten minutes in the meager amount of shade that it offered.
</p>
<p>
  Past the bridge, we walked on a road for a while.  We probably saw
  ten white trucks driving on the road, and no other vehicles.
  Clearly, this was a place where the only practical conveyance was a
  white truck.
</p>
<p>
  It was only noon by the time we reached our destination.  This was a
  small stream with a bridge over it, a spigot with cool water, and a
  small piece of corrugated tin on the other side of the bridge acting
  as a generator of shade.  We put down our mats and tried to get some
  sleep.  By this time, I was not feeling very well and did not eat
  much for supper that afternoon.

<p>
  The next morning, we were up at 2:30 and repeated our night-hiking
  stunt from the morning before.  As we walked up the hill out of the
  desert, we hit an enormous head wind.  So we were walking up hill
  and into the wind &ndash; not a pleasant experience.  On top of this, I
  was still not feeling well, so this part of the hike does not stick
  out as one of my favorite.
</p>
<p>
  We got lost a couple of times in the dark.  The trail follows an
  ill-defined network of roads that aren't really roads, and it was
  quite easy to get on the wrong one.  Eventually we found a campsite
  (with people still sleeping in it), so we knew we were on the right
  path.  It was also hard not to feel a little smug, knowing that we
  had already walked about 10 miles and were passing people who were
  not yet awake.
</p>
<p>
  As we walked on, the wind was a near-constant annoyance.  However,
  we would see that it had a real use.  We walked straight into one of
  the largest wind farms in the world.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZYF-QpSOFXo/TnvCMkzT_AI/AAAAAAAACb4/Ur-o8Mh4KzY/s800/DSCF0597.JPG"  alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZYF-QpSOFXo/TnvCMkzT_AI/AAAAAAAACb4/Ur-o8Mh4KzY/s800/DSCF0597.JPG" />
</p>
<p>
  By early afternoon, we had made it to a road, and I was beat.  It
  was not our destination, but the combination of not feeling well and
  the early rising of the previous days killed my energy.  Garby
  caught up with me, and together we decided to hitch into town.  We
  needed to go to the post office, and as soon as that business was
  taken care of, we got a hotel room and turned the air conditioner
  on.
</p>
<p>
  It turned out that Garby had caught whatever it was that I had.  It
  seemed like he still ate as much as usual, but he threw it up
  shortly thereafter.  I managed to moderate my eating so that I
  wouldn't throw up, but it was easy to decide that we needed to
  recuperate a little, so we took another zero.

<p>
  The nice lady who had given us a ride from the post office to the
  hotel had also given us her phone number and told us to call if we
  needed anything.  Neither of us felt like hitching out of town, so
  we took her up on it.  I think she was a bit surprised to hear from
  us again, but she was game.  On our way out of town, she took us
  past a friend's farm where a bison had just given birth.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  After plenty of ooh-ing and aah-ing, we got back to the trail and
  started hiking again.
</p>
<p>
  We walked through the remainder of the wind farm and across a
  highway, and we left the section.  Of all the hiking that I did,
  that might have been my least favorite section.  It was constantly
  hot (though I actually got somewhat lucky with the weather &ndash; others
  had it much hotter than I did), and both I and my hiking partner got
  sick.  The first two days weren't bad, but the last two certainly
  made up for that.

  I may combine the next section with half of the following one so
  that I get to the start of the Sierras.  I'm as excited to write
  about my experience in the Sierras as I was to get to them.
